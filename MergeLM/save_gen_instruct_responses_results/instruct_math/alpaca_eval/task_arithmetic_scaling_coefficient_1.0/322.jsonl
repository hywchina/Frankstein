{"instruction": "How do I cook a salmon fillet on a stove top pan?", "output": "To cook a salmon fillet on a stovetop pan, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a pan: Select a stovetop-safe pan that is large enough to hold the salmon fillet. A non-stick or cast iron pan is ideal.\n\n2. Prepare the salmon: Wash the salmon fillet under cold water to remove any impurities. Pat it dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n\n3. Season the salmon: Apply your desired seasonings to the salmon. This could be salt, pepper, lemon juice, garlic, or any other herbs and spices you prefer. Make sure the pan is lightly oiled or well-seasoned to prevent the salmon from sticking.\n\n4. Heat the pan: Place the pan over medium-high heat on your stovetop. If using a cast iron pan, let it heat up for a few minutes to preheat the surface.\n\n5. Add oil or butter: Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan. This will help prevent the salmon from sticking and add flavor.\n\n6. Cook the salmon: Place the salmon fillet, skin side down (if it has skin), into the preheated pan. If it doesn't have skin, you can place it in either way you prefer. Cook the salmon for 3-4 minutes on the first side.\n\n7. Flip the salmon: After 3-4 minutes, carefully flip the salmon fillet over using a spatula. Cook the other side for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and the internal temperature reaches 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C).\n\n8. Serve: Once the salmon is cooked, remove it from the pan and serve it immediately. You can serve it with a variety of sides, such as rice, vegetables, or a salad.\n\nRemember to handle the salmon carefully during the cooking process, as it can be delicate and prone to breaking apart. By following these steps, you'll have a perfectly cooked salmon fillet on your stovetop pan.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
