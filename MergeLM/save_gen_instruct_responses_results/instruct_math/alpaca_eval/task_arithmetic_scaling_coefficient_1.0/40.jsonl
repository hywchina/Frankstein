{"instruction": "When was Canada colonized?", "output": "Canada was colonized by Europeans over a long period of time, with different regions being colonized by different countries at different times. Here's a brief overview of the colonization process:\n\n1. **Viking Colonization (1000-1300 AD)**: The first known European explorers to reach Canada were the Vikings, led by Leif Erikson. They established a settlement in Newfoundland around 1000 AD. This is considered the first European colonization of Canada.\n\n2. **French Colonization (1534-1763)**: In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier planted a cross in Gasp\u00e9, Quebec, marking the beginning of French colonization. Over the next few centuries, the French established several colonies in what is now Quebec and the Maritime provinces.\n\n3. **British Colonization (1608-1867)**: In 1608, the British established their first permanent settlement in Canada at Quebec. Over time, they expanded their colonies and established a series of forts and trading posts along the coast. By the mid-19th century, the British had colonized much of what is now Canada.\n\n4. **Spanish and Portuguese Colonization (16th-17th Century)**: Although less significant than the French and British colonization, there were also some Spanish and Portuguese explorers who established temporary settlements along the coasts of Canada.\n\n5. **American Colonization (1775-1783)**: During the American Revolution, American colonists who remained loyal to the British crown established colonies in Canada, particularly in the Saint John River Valley in New Brunswick.\n\nSo, to answer the question, \"When was Canada colonized?\" it's more accurate to say that Canada was colonized over a period of several centuries, from the 10th century with the arrival of the Vikings, to the 19th century with the expansion of the British colonies. The exact timeline of colonization is complex and involved multiple groups and countries.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
