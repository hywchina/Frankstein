{"instruction": "I want to open the developler tools in chrome with ctrl + shift + i on this website: https://mnsw.pro/\nIt doesnt work. works on other websites. even here. what is wrong?", "output": "The issue you're experiencing with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + I not working in Chrome on the given website might be due to a specific setting in the website's developer tools or a temporary issue with the website itself. Here's a more detailed step-by-step process to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. Ensure the website is not blocking the shortcut: Some websites might have specific rules or permissions that block or override the standard keyboard shortcuts. In this case, try disabling any ad blockers or pop-up blockers, as they might interfere with the shortcut.\n\n2. Check the website's developer tools settings: Navigate to the website's developer tools by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + I (or Cmd + Option + I on a Mac). Once the developer tools are open, look for an option called \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" or \"Shortcuts\" in the settings menu. Ensure that the \"Open the developer tools\" shortcut is not overridden or blocked.\n\n3. Update your Chrome browser: Make sure you're using the latest version of the Chrome browser. Sometimes, updates can resolve issues with keyboard shortcuts or compatibility with certain websites.\n\n4. Try another device or browser: If possible, try opening the website on another device or browser to see if the keyboard shortcut works. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your device or browser.\n\n5. Contact the website's support or developer: If you've tried all the above steps and the keyboard shortcut still doesn't work, you might want to reach out to the website's support or the developer. They can provide more specific information about any known issues or configurations that might be causing the problem.\n\nRemember, the website you provided (<https://mnsw.pro/>) seems to be a parked domain, and it's not clear when it will be active again.
