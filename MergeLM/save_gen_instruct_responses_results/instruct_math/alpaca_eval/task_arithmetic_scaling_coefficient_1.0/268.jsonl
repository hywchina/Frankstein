{"instruction": "Marley has $20 left when she turns 21 years old. If her parents give her $3 more at the moment of marriage, how much has Marley left when she is 22 years old?", "output": "First, we need to determine how much money Marley has before her parents give her any money. We know that she has $20 of her own and then receives an additional $3 from her parents. So, we can calculate this by adding these two amounts together:\n\nStep 1: Calculate initial money before marriage\n$20 (Marley's own money) + $3 (parent's gift) = $<<20+3=23>>23\n\nNow we know that Marley has $23 before her parents give her any money.\n\nNext, we need to consider the $3 that her parents give her at the moment of marriage. We need to add this amount to the $23 she already has to find out how much money she has in total when she is 22 years old.\n\nStep 2: Calculate total money at age 22\n$23 (total money before marriage) + $3 (parent's gift) = $<<23+3=26>>26\n\nSo, Marley has a total of $26 when she is 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, the detailed and clear answer is: Marley has $26 left when she is 22 years old.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
