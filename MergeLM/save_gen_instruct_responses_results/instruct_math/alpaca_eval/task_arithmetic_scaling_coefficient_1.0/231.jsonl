Ease of use: The SaaS survey tool could be designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users of all technical backgrounds to create and distribute surveys. This could be a key selling point, as many people are intimidated by complex survey tools.\n\n2. Customization: The tool could offer a high level of customization, allowing users to create surveys that perfectly fit their specific needs. This could include the ability to choose from a wide range of question types, create custom branching logic, and brand the survey with their own logo and colors.\n\n3. Integration: The tool could integrate seamlessly with other popular tools and platforms, such as CRM systems, marketing automation tools, and analytics platforms. This would allow users to easily import and analyze survey data, and automate the process of sending surveys to their customers or leads.\n\n4. Advanced analytics: The tool could offer advanced analytics capabilities, such as predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, and real-time reporting. This would allow users to gain deeper insights into their customers' opinions and behaviors, and make more informed decisions based on this data.\n\n5. Affordability: The tool could be priced at a lower cost than similar tools in the market, making it accessible to a wider range of businesses and individuals.

Excellent customer support: The company offering the SaaS survey tool could provide exceptional customer support, including 24/7 live chat, email support, and a comprehensive knowledge base. This would help to build trust with customers and ensure they get the help they need when they need it.\n\nBy focusing on one or more of these USPs, a SaaS survey tool can differentiate itself from competitors and provide a compelling reason for potential customers to choose it over other options.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
