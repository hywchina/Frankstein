{"instruction": "How to make frosting with crisco", "output": "To make frosting with Crisco, you can follow these steps:\n\nIngredients:\n1. Crisco (shortening)\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Vanilla extract (optional)\n4. Milk or water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Softening the Crisco: Cut the Crisco into a large mixing bowl. You can use a hand or stand mixer to do this. If you're doing it by hand, use a wooden spoon or an electric mixer to beat the Crisco until it becomes soft and pliable. This should take about 2-3 minutes.\n\n2. Adding the powdered sugar: Gradually add the powdered sugar to the softened Crisco. If you're using a mixer, you can use the paddle or beater attachment. Mix the powdered sugar into the Crisco until it's fully incorporated. This will give you a smooth, white frosting.\n\n3. Adding the vanilla extract (optional): If you want to add a flavor to your frosting, now is the time to do it. You can add a few drops of vanilla extract to the mixture. Mix this in thoroughly to ensure the flavor is evenly distributed.\n\n4. Adding the milk or water: The amount of milk or water you add will depend on the consistency you want for your frosting. If you want a stiffer frosting, add less liquid. If you want a softer, more spreadable frosting, add more. Start with a small amount (1/4 teaspoon of milk or water) and adjust from there. Mix this in until the frosting reaches the desired consistency.\n\n5. Mixing the frosting: Continue to mix the frosting until it's smooth and has a consistency you're happy with. This could take a few more minutes, especially if you're adding a lot of powdered sugar or if you're trying to achieve a specific consistency.\n\nRemember, the key to a good frosting is to be patient and to not over-mix. This will result in a frosting that's too tough and not as fluffy. Once you've got your frosting the way you like it, you can use it immediately or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\nThe ratio for this frosting is generally 1 part Crisco to 3-4 parts powdered sugar. This gives you a good balance between the shortening and the sugar, resulting in a frosting that's both sweet and stable.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
