{"instruction": "Give students tips on how to keep their nerves under control during class presentations.", "output": "1. **Prepare Thoroughly**: The more prepared you are, the less likely you are to feel nervous. Rehearse your presentation several times, know your material inside out, and anticipate any questions that might come up.\n\n2. **Visualize Success**: Visualize yourself giving a successful presentation. Imagine the audience listening attentively and responding positively. This can help boost your confidence and reduce nerves.\n\n3. **Take Deep Breaths**: Before you start your presentation, take a few deep breaths. This can help calm your nerves and slow down your heart rate. You can also take a few deep breaths during the presentation if you feel your nerves getting the better of you.\n\n4. **Speak Slowly and Clearly**: Speaking too fast can make you sound nervous and can also make it harder for the audience to follow your presentation. Speak at a pace that is comfortable for you and make sure to enunciate your words clearly.\n\n5. **Maintain Eye Contact**: Making eye contact with the audience can help you connect with them and make you feel more confident. However, don't force it if it's not natural for you. Instead, try to focus on the people who are most likely to ask questions or provide feedback.\n\n6. **Use Positive Self-Talk**: Instead of telling yourself you're going to fail or that you're not good enough, try to use positive self-talk. Tell yourself that you're prepared, that you know your stuff, and that you're going to do a great job.\n\n7. **Remember That It's Okay to Make Mistakes**: Everyone makes mistakes, even experienced speakers. The important thing is to learn from them and move on. If you do make a mistake, don't let it throw you off. Keep going and try not to let it affect the rest of your presentation.\n\n8. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking water before your presentation can help keep your vocal cords hydrated and your throat moist, which can help you speak more clearly and confidently.\n\n9. **Seek Feedback**: After your presentation, ask for feedback from a trusted friend or teacher. This can help you identify areas where you can improve and also give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\n10. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: The more you practice, the less nervous you'll be. Try to practice your presentation in front of a mirror, record yourself, or present to a friend or family member. The more you present, the more comfortable you'll become.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
