{"instruction": "How do I make escargot?", "output": "Escargot is a classic French dish made from snails, typically served as an appetizer. The dish is typically made with snails, garlic, butter, and parsley. Here's a simple recipe to make escargot:\n\nIngredients:\n1. Snails: You can either buy them fresh from a fishmonger or canned from a supermarket. If you're using fresh snails, make sure they're cleaned and purged of any sand or dirt.\n\n2. Garlic: You'll need a generous amount of garlic for this recipe. You can use fresh or jarred garlic.\n\n3. Butter: High-quality, unsalted butter is essential for the rich flavor of the escargot.\n\n4. Parsley: Fresh parsley is used for garnish and flavor.\n\n5. Salt and pepper: These are for seasoning the snails.\n\nNow, let's move to the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Preparation: If using fresh snails, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes to remove any dirt or sand. Then, remove the snails from the shells and set them aside.\n\n2. Garlic and butter: Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until it's soft and fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can quickly become bitter.\n\n3. Snail cooking: Add the snails to the garlic butter mixture. If the snails are fresh, they will cook in the garlic butter for a few minutes, turning them over to ensure they're fully coated. If you're using canned snails, you can skip this step.\n\n4. Seasoning: Remove the snails from the heat and season them with salt and pepper.\n\n5. Serving: Place the snails back into their shells, piling them in a small baking dish or ramekins. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.\n\nRemember, the key to a good escargot is the quality of the ingredients. Fresh snails, garlic, and butter will make a big difference in the flavor of the dish. Enjoy your homemade escargot!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
