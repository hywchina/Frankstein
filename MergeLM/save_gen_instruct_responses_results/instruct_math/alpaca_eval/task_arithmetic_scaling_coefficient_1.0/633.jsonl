{"instruction": "Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.\n\nA study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.", "output": "The article discusses a study conducted by Zee and her team that focuses on the impact of light on sleep in healthy adults in their 20s. The study found that sleeping with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, can cause an increase in both blood sugar and heart rate. \n\nThe increase in heart rate during sleep is a risk factor for potential heart diseases and early death, as per previous studies. This suggests that even a single night of disrupted sleep due to dim light could have long-term implications for cardiovascular health.\n\nMoreover, the study also highlights that elevated blood sugar levels during sleep are indicative of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a condition where the body becomes less responsive to insulin, leading to an increase in blood sugar levels. This can eventually lead to the development of type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar.\n\nIn conclusion, the study emphasizes the importance of maintaining a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment to ensure optimal sleep quality. Disruptions in sleep due to light exposure can have significant implications for overall health, particularly in terms of cardiovascular health and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial for healthy adults to prioritize a good sleep environment to maintain their long-term health and well-being.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
