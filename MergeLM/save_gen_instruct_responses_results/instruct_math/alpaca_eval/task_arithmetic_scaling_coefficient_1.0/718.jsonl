In this context, it's about holding onto a promise or commitment.\n\n\"Promise\" is a statement or agreement that someone intends to do a certain thing or to give a certain thing to another person. \n\nSo, when we say \"keep a promise,\" it means to stay true to your word, to do what you said you would do, or to not break the commitment you made. It's about being reliable and trustworthy, which are important qualities to have when you say you're going to do something and then follow through with it.\n\nTherefore, for kids, keeping a promise would mean doing what you said you would do, being reliable, and showing that you can be trusted. It's about being a person of your word, even when it's not easy or convenient.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
