{"instruction": "Can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem?", "output": "Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous theorem in number theory, which is a branch of mathematics. It was first proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637. The theorem is central to the study of the properties of numbers known as integers, which are the natural numbers and their negatives.\n\nThe theorem itself is quite complex and is stated as follows: \"If an integer a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a and two integers, b^2 + b - 2 and 2b + 2 - 4, are not multiples of any integer greater than 2.\" This means that if a number 'a' is not divisible by 2 or 3, then 'a' cannot be expressed as the difference between two squares (or the product of two numbers) in the way that Fermat describes.\n\nThe theorem was a major breakthrough in the field of number theory because it established a fundamental principle about the best possible approximation of a number. It also opened up a new area of research, as it was one of the first theorems to demonstrate the power and limitations of a particular approach to number theory known as 'proof by contradiction'.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the theorem is quite complex and its proof, which was eventually found by the German mathematician Euler, is even more complex and requires a deep understanding of advanced mathematical concepts. So, while I can explain the theorem and its significance, the full details of the theorem and its proof are beyond the scope of a simple explanation.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
