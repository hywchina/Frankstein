{"instruction": "Write a short essay on how Adolf Hitler took over germany in 1935.", "output": "Adolf Hitler's takeover of Germany in 1935 was a result of a combination of factors, including political maneuvering, propaganda, and the weakened state of the Weimar Republic. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. Appointment as Chancellor: In 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. Hitler was the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party), and his appointment was a result of the party's growing popularity and the centrist parties' inability to form a stable government.\n\n2. Consolidation of Power: After his appointment, Hitler quickly began to consolidate his power. He used the Reichstag fire, a suspicious blaze that destroyed the German parliament building, to declare a state of emergency and suspend civil liberties. This allowed him to bypass the legislative branch and rule by decree.\n\n3. Enabling Act: In March 1933, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which gave Hitler the power to make laws without the need for parliamentary approval. This act marked the beginning of Hitler's dictatorship.\n\n4. Suppression of Opposition: Hitler's regime was marked by the systematic suppression of any opposition. He banned other political parties, including the Communist Party, and used the Gestapo, a secret police force, to silence dissent. The media was also controlled, and propaganda was used to promote Hitler's ideology and policies.\n\n5. Economic Recovery: Hitler implemented policies that led to a significant economic recovery in Germany. These included public works projects, such as the construction of the Autobahn and the promotion of the automobile industry, which created jobs and improved living standards.\n\n6. Militarization and Aggression: As Hitler's power grew, he began to militarize Germany and pursue an aggressive foreign policy. He rebuilt the German military, which was limited by the Treaty of Versailles, and annexed Austria and the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia.\n\n7. Final Takeover: By 1935, Hitler had effectively taken over Germany. He had consolidated his power, suppressed opposition, and implemented policies that improved the economy and enhanced Germany's military strength. The Weimar Republic had been replaced by the Third Reich, a dictatorship led by Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn conclusion, Adolf Hitler's takeover of Germany in 1935 was a result of a combination of factors, including his appointment as Chancellor, the consolidation of power, the suppression of opposition, and the implementation of policies that improved the economy and enhanced Germany's military strength. His regime would go on to have a profound impact on the world, leading to World War II and the deaths of millions of people.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
