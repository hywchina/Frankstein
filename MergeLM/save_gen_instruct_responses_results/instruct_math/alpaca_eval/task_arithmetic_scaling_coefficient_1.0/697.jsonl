{"instruction": "Convert natural language into a list of turn-by-turn directions.\n\nGo west on I-10 until you hit the 101 then take it north. You will eventually see the Hollywood sign.", "output": "1. Start by understanding the given instructions: The first step is to head west on I-10, which is a major interstate highway in the United States. This means you need to drive in a westerly direction on I-10.\n\n2. The next step is to continue on I-10 until you reach the 101. The 101 is also an interstate highway, but this time, you need to turn from I-10 onto I-101. So, once you're on I-10, keep driving west until you reach the point where I-10 and I-101 intersect.\n\n3. Once you've reached the intersection of I-10 and I-101, you're supposed to take I-101 north. This means you need to change your direction from west to north, and start driving northward along I-101.\n\n4. As you're driving north on I-101, the instructions tell us that you will eventually see the Hollywood sign. This is a famous landmark in Los Angeles, California, so you know you're on the right track.\n\n5. Keep driving north on I-101 until you reach the Hollywood sign. This is your final destination, so once you see the sign, you can stop your journey.\n\nSo, the detailed, logical, and clear turn-by-turn directions from the given natural language are:\n\n1. Go west on I-10.\n2. Continue on I-10 and take it until you reach the 101.\n3. Once you're on I-101, take it north.\n4. Keep driving north on I-101 until you see the Hollywood sign.\n\nRemember, these directions assume that you're starting from a point east of the intersection of I-10 and I-101. If you're starting from a different location, you might need to adjust the directions accordingly.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
