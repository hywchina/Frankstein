{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Tunisian dishes. Can you give me a recipe Tunisian Kammounia?", "output": "Certainly! Tunisian Kammounia, also known as Shakshuka, is a popular dish in Tunisia and other North African countries. It's a hearty, flavorful stew made with eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce. Here's a simple recipe to try:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 large onion, chopped\n2. 2-3 garlic cloves, minced\n3. 1 red bell pepper, chopped\n4. 1 green bell pepper, chopped\n5. 1 can of chopped tomatoes (14.5 oz)\n6. 1 cup of water\n7. 1 tsp of cumin\n8. 1 tsp of paprika\n9. Salt and pepper to taste\n10. 2-3 eggs per person (for serving)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Begin by preparing the vegetables. Chop the onion, garlic, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Set them aside.\n\n2. In a large pan, heat a couple of tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\n3. Add the minced garlic to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.\n\n4. Add the chopped tomatoes, cup of water, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper to the pan. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n\n5. While the sauce is simmering, prepare the eggs. You can leave them whole or slice them, depending on your preference.\n\n6. When the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together, create small wells in the sauce by poking the surface with a spoon. Gently crack an egg into each well, being careful not to break the yolk.\n\n7. Cover the pan and let the eggs cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. This is where the Kammounia gets its unique flavor and texture.\n\n8. Serve the Tunisian Kammounia hot, garnished with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired. The eggs should be cooked to your desired level of doneness, but the traditional way is to have a runny yolk for dipping the bread into.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Tunisian Kammounia with some crusty bread for dipping in the spicy tomato sauce!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
