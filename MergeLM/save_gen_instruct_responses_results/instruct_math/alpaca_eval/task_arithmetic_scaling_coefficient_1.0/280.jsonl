{"instruction": "Can a qualifying manager work remotely abroad for US employer for an year be eligible for Eb1-C while on h1-b", "output": "The Eb1-C visa, also known as the EB-1C, is a category of the Employment-Based Immigration Program in the United States. It's designed for managers and executives of foreign companies who are relocating to the U.S. to work in a managerial or executive capacity for a branch of their own company or a subsidiary.\n\nOn the other hand, the H1-B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations.\n\nThe eligibility for these visas is determined by a complex set of rules and regulations. The key factor here is the \"specialty occupation\" requirement for the H1-B visa, which typically means the job must require a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nNow, let's break down the given information:\n\n1. A qualifying manager works remotely abroad for a US employer for a year. \n\n2. The question asks if this manager can be eligible for both Eb1-C and H1-B visas simultaneously.\n\nIn theory, it's possible for a qualifying manager to be eligible for both visas, but there are some important factors to consider:\n\n- The manager must be working for a U.S. employer in a managerial or executive capacity, which aligns with the criteria for the Eb1-C visa.\n- The job must also meet the H1-B visa's \"specialty occupation\" requirement, which typically means the job must require a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the H1-B visa is a non-immigrant visa, meaning it's for individuals who are not intending to immigrate to the U.S. permanently. The Eb1-C visa, on the other hand, is an immigrant visa, which means it's for individuals who are intending to immigrate to the U.S. permanently.\n\nIn practice, the eligibility for these visas can depend on a variety of factors, including the specific job duties, the qualifications of the manager, and the policies of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nTherefore, while it's theoretically possible for a qualifying manager to be eligible for both Eb1-C and H1-B visas, the decision on eligibility would ultimately be made by the USCIS based on a detailed review of the individual case. It's always recommended to consult with an immigration attorney or expert to understand the specific requirements and procedures for these visas.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
