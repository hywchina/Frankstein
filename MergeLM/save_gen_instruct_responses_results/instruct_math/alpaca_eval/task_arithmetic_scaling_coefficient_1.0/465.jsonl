{"instruction": "What is the Balfour Declaration?", "output": "The Balfour Declaration is a significant document in the history of the Middle East and the British Empire. It was issued on November 2, 1917, by the British government, and it expressed the government's support for the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, which was then under Ottoman rule.\n\nThe declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time. The document was addressed to Lord Rothschild, a prominent British Jew, and it read:\n\n\"His Majesty's government views with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\"\n\nThe Balfour Declaration is considered a key moment in the Zionist movement's efforts to establish a Jewish homeland. It marked the first time a major world power publicly expressed support for the idea, and it helped pave the way for the eventual establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.\n\nHowever, the declaration also had significant implications for the Arab population of Palestine, who at the time were the majority inhabitants of the region. The declaration is seen by some as a promise that was not fully kept, as the subsequent establishment of Israel led to the displacement of many Palestinians and ongoing conflict in the region.\n\nToday, the Balfour Declaration remains a controversial topic, with some viewing it as a betrayal of the Arab people and a root cause of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while others see it as a necessary step towards the establishment of a Jewish state.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
