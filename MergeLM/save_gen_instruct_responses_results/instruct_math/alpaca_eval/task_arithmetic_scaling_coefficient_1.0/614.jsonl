{"instruction": "Prove the given statement using your information.\n\n\"If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.\"", "output": "The given statement can be proven in two parts: x is a positive integer and x > 12.\n\n1. Proof that x is a positive integer:\n\nThe statement x + 3 > 4 is given. If x is not a positive integer, then the only other possibility is that x is a negative integer or zero. However, if x were a negative integer or zero, the addition of 3 would not make the result positive, i.e., x + 3 would still be less than or equal to 0. This contradicts the condition that x + 3 > 4. Therefore, x must be a positive integer.\n\n2. Proof that x > 12:\n\nThe statement x > 12 is a straightforward condition. It simply states that the value of x must be greater than 12. This is a basic inequality that can be directly compared with the value of x. If x is greater than 12, then the statement is true. If x is less than or equal to 12, then the statement is false.\n\nCombining both proofs:\n\nSince we have already proven that x is a positive integer and x > 12, and these conditions are not mutually exclusive (meaning they can both be true at the same time), we can conclude that if x is a positive integer or a solution to x + 3 > 4, then x > 0 and x > 12. This is because the conditions of being a positive integer and being greater than 12 are both met.\n\nThus, the given statement is proven to be true.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
