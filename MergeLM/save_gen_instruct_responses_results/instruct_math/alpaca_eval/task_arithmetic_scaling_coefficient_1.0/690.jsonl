{"instruction": "As part of software engineering, user stories describe what the user wants the system to do, while acceptance criteria describe the conditions a specific user story must meet. Create basic acceptance criteria based on the given user story.\n\nUser story: As a user, I want to use a search field to type a city, name, or street, so that I could find matching hotel options.", "output": "To create basic acceptance criteria based on the given user story, we need to define the conditions that the system must meet for the user to have a satisfactory experience when using the search field. Here are some acceptance criteria:\n\n1. **Search Field Availability**: The search field must be available and accessible on the website or application. This means it should be prominently displayed and easily clickable/typeable without any technical issues.\n\n2. **Input Validity**: The system must accept the input of a city, name, or street in the search field. It should be able to process and understand these types of inputs without any errors or exceptions.\n\n3. **Search Process**: When the user types a character in the search field, the system must respond by starting the search process. This could involve making an API call to a database or another system to find matching hotel options.\n\n4. **Search Results**: The search process must return relevant hotel options that match the user's input. The relevance of the results can be determined by factors such as distance from the user's location, star rating, price, and other user preferences if available.\n\n5. **Display of Results**: The search results must be displayed in a clear and organized manner. This could include the hotel name, location, distance from the user's location, price, and other relevant information.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The system must handle any errors or exceptions that occur during the search process. This could include network errors, server errors, or invalid input errors. The user should be notified of these errors in a clear and understandable manner.\n\n7. **Performance**: The search function should perform well under various conditions, including high user loads and large amounts of data. This means the system should be optimized to handle multiple simultaneous searches and large datasets.\n\n8. **User Experience**: The overall experience of using the search field and viewing the search results should be intuitive and user-friendly. This includes factors such as clear instructions, easy navigation, and aesthetic design.\n\nThese acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring that the system meets the user's needs and expectations when using the search field to find hotel options.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
