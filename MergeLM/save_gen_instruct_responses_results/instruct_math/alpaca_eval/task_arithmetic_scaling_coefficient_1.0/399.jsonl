{"instruction": "Hi, can you tell me a story in a novel format including dialogs between the characters, a story based on the Justice League comics, including the characters, Green Arrow, Red Arrow and Cheshire.", "output": "Title: \"The Triple Shot of Trouble\"\n\nIn the bustling city of Star City, the night was as dark as the mood of its protector, Green Arrow. He sat in his hideout, his eyes fixed on the monitor, watching the city's crime rate. His son, Red Arrow, was by his side, sharpening his arrows.\n\n\"Father, we've had a string of robberies tonight,\" Red Arrow said, not looking up from his work.\n\nGreen Arrow sighed, \"I know. I've been tracking them. They're too well-coordinated to be your average thieves.\"\n\nJust then, a woman's laughter echoed in the hideout. \"Well, well, well. If it isn't my favorite family of vigilantes.\" Cheshire, a notorious villain known for her unpredictable behavior, appeared in front of them.\n\n\"Cheshire,\" Green Arrow growled, standing up. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Just dropping by to see my favorite heroes. You two are so predictable,\" she said, her eyes gleaming with mischief.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Red Arrow asked, standing up, his arrows at the ready.\n\n\"Oh, I think you'll find out soon enough,\" she said, disappearing and reappearing on the rooftop, laughing.\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow exchanged a look. They knew Cheshire was up to something big. They followed her to the location she had disappeared from, a bank that was being robbed.\n\nInside, they found Cheshire, along with her team of professional thieves, including the Weeper, a man who could control tears, and the Tiger, a martial arts expert.\n\n\"You're in over your heads, Cheshire,\" Green Arrow warned.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Oliver. This is just the beginning,\" she replied, her eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\nThe battle was intense. The Weeper made the streets slippery, causing Green Arrow and Red Arrow to stumble, while the Tiger fought Red Arrow in close combat. Green Arrow used his superior archery skills to take down the thieves one by one, but Cheshire was always one step ahead, disappearing and reappearing at will.\n\n\"You're good, Oliver, but you're not as unpredictable as you used to be,\" Cheshire taunted.\n\nGreen Arrow's eyes narrowed. \"You're right. I'm not as unpredictable as I used to be. But I have something that can even the odds.\"\n\nHe pulled out a device from his utility belt, a device that emitted a frequency that could disrupt Cheshire's teleportation powers. With this, Green Arrow was able to pinpoint Cheshire's location and land a blow that sent her flying.\n\nThe thieves, realizing they were outmatched, surrendered. Green Arrow and Red Arrow had saved the day, but they knew that Cheshire would be back, and they would have to be ready for her next move.\n\nAs they returned to their hideout, Red Arrow turned to his father, \"You know, I've been thinking. It's time for me to take on more responsibility. I want to be the one to keep an eye on Cheshire.\"\n\nGreen Arrow nodded, \"I know you're ready, Roy. Together, we'll keep this city safe from villains like Cheshire.\"\n\nAnd so, the father and son duo, along with their allies, continued their fight against crime, always ready for the next triple shot of trouble.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
