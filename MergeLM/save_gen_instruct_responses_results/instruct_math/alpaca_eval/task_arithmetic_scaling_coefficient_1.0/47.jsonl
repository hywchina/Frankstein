I am interested in trying some Mauritian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Mine Frite?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Mine Frite is a popular Mauritian dish that is essentially a meat pie, but instead of being made with beef or chicken, it's made with fish. Here's a simple recipe to try:\n\nIngredients:\n1 pound of fish (you can use any white fish like cod, tilapia, or even salmon, but in Mauritius, they typically use wahoo or tuna)\n1 onion, finely chopped\n2 cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon of ginger paste\n1 teaspoon of curry powder\n1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder\n1/2 teaspoon of salt\n1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n1/4 cup of vegetable oil\n1/2 cup of breadcrumbs\n1 egg, beaten\n1/2 cup of milk\n1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. First, prepare the fish: Cut the fish into small pieces and set aside.\n\n2. In a pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 until the onion is translucent.\n\n3. Add the ginger paste, curry powder, cumin powder, salt, and cayenne pepper (if using) to the pan. Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic.\n\n4. Add the fish pieces to the pan and stir to coat them evenly with the spice mixture.\n\n5. In a separate bowl, mix the breadcrumbs and egg together to form the batter. Add the milk and stir until the breadcrumbs are fully absorbed.\n\n6. Grease a baking dish with a little oil and pour the fish mixture into it.\n\n7. Spread the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the fish, covering the entire surface.\n\n8. Bake the Mine Frite in a preheated oven at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the fish is cooked through.\n\n9. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped cilantro, if desired.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Mine Frite!
