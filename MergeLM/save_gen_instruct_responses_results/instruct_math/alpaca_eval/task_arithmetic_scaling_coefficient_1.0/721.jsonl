{"instruction": "Design a simple training challenge on Strava that everyone could attend.", "output": "As an AI, I can't directly create a training challenge on Strava, but I can certainly help you design one! Here's a simple training challenge idea that anyone can attend:\n\n1. **Challenge Name**: \"Spring into Fitness\"\n\n2. **Objective**: The objective of this challenge is to encourage people to get more active during the spring season. It can be a fun way to motivate people to start exercising regularly or to push themselves to achieve new personal bests.\n\n3. **Challenge Period**: The challenge can run for a duration of 4-6 weeks, depending on the level of commitment you want from participants.\n\n4. **Challenge Goals**: Participants can set their own goals, such as running a certain distance, completing a certain number of workouts, or improving their personal best times. These goals should be achievable yet challenging.\n\n5. **Points System**: Implement a point system where participants earn points for achieving their goals. For instance, setting a new personal best could earn them 10 points, while completing a certain number of workouts in a week could earn them 5 points.\n\n6. **Leaderboard**: Create a leaderboard where participants can see their standing compared to others. This can be a great motivator, as people often enjoy a little bit of friendly competition.\n\n7. **Prizes**: Consider offering prizes for the top performers. These could be anything from Strava-related items (like a new heart rate monitor or a Strava jersey) to fitness-related items (like a yoga mat or a protein powder).\n\n8. **Promotion**: Promote the challenge on social media and Strava's community section. Encourage participants to invite their friends and share their progress.\n\n9. **Support**: Offer support and advice to participants. This could be in the form of training plans, nutrition tips, or motivational messages.\n\n10. **Follow-up**: After the challenge, follow up with participants to see how they're doing and to congratulate them on their achievements. This can help keep them engaged and motivated for future challenges.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful challenge is clear communication, achievable goals, and a supportive community. Good luck with your Strava training challenge!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
