{"instruction": "Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "output": "Kobe beef is considered one of the most expensive types of beef in the world, and there are several reasons for this:\n\n1. Exclusive Breed: Kobe beef comes from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle, which is raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan. This breed is known for its exceptional marbling, which contributes to its unique flavor and tenderness. The rarity of this breed and the limited number of cattle raised for Kobe beef contribute to its high price.\n\n2. Feeding Practices: Kobe cattle are fed a special diet that includes beer and sake, which is not typical for most cattle. This diet is more expensive than the standard feed given to other cattle, and it results in a unique flavor profile that is highly sought after by chefs and food connoisseurs.\n\n3. Aging Process: Kobe beef is aged for a longer period than other beef, typically 21 to 30 days. This aging process allows the meat to become more tender and flavorful, but it also increases the cost.\n\n4. Quality Control: The production of Kobe beef is tightly controlled by the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association. They have strict guidelines for the breed, feed, and aging process, which ensures the consistently high quality of the beef. However, this control also contributes to the higher price.\n\n5. Prestige and Demand: Kobe beef is renowned for its quality and is considered a luxury item. The high price is partly due to the prestige and demand from restaurants, chefs, and consumers who are willing to pay a premium for this exclusive product.\n\n6. Distribution: Kobe beef is not widely available due to the strict controls on its production and distribution. This limited availability contributes to its high price.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the exclusive breed, special feeding practices, longer aging process, quality control, prestige, and limited distribution all contribute to the high price of Kobe beef.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
