{"instruction": "Translate the natural language description into a Google Sheets formula.\n\nif C7 is equal to \"U.S.A.\" or \"Canada\" or \"Europe\" or \"The Americas\"", "output": "To create a formula in Google Sheets that checks if the value in cell C7 is equal to \"U.S.A.\", \"Canada\", \"Europe\", or \"The Americas\", you can use the OR operator (LOGICAL_OR) in conjunction with the TEXTVALUE function to split the region into an array of values. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assume the value in cell C7 is in a cell named `country`.\n2. Create an array of the regions to check: `regions` = {\"U.S.A.\", \"Canada\", \"Europe\", \"The Americas\"}.\n3. Use the TEXTVALUE function to split the region into an array of values. The formula will be: `=array_contains(regions, country)`.\n4. The OR operator (LOGICAL_OR) will return true if at least one of the conditions is true. So, the final formula will be: `=LOGICAL_OR(array_contains(regions, country))`.\n\nPlease note that the TEXTVALUE function is not available in Google Sheets. Instead, you can use the ISBETWEEN function to check if the country is in the list of regions. Here's the updated formula:\n\n```\n=LOGICAL_OR(\n  OR(C7 = \"U.S.A.\", C7 = \"Canada\", C7 = \"Europe\", C7 = \"The Americas\"),\n  OR(BETWEEN(C7, \"U.S.A.\") || BETWEEN(C7, \"Canada\") || BETWEEN(C7, \"Europe\") || BETWEEN(C7, \"The Americas\")),\n  OR(REGEXMATCH(C7, \"U.S.A|Canada|Europe|The Americas\")))\n)\n```\n\nThis formula checks if the value in cell C7 is equal to any of the given regions using the OR operator. It first checks if the value is exactly one of the given regions, then checks if the value is in the list of regions using the BETWEEN operator with the OR operator, and finally checks if the value matches the pattern of any of the given regions using the REGEXMATCH function.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
