Here's a simple Python function that does this:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's a prime number and `False` otherwise. Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, the function checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `False` because prime numbers are defined as numbers greater than 1.\n\n2. Next, the function enters a loop that starts from 2 (the smallest prime number) and goes up to the square root of `n`. The loop checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, the function returns `False` because a prime number cannot be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. If the loop completes without finding any divisors of `n`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.\n\nYou can use this function in your Python code to automatically determine if a number is prime, speeding up your development process. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(is_prime(5))  # True, because 5 is a prime number\nprint(is_prime(6))  # False, because 6 is not a prime number\n```", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
