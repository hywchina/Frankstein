{"instruction": "How do I detail a car?", "output": "Detailing a car is a process that involves cleaning both the exterior and interior of the vehicle to make it look like new. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to detail a car:\n\n1. **Gather All Necessary Supplies**: Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary supplies. These include a bucket, car wash soap, microfiber towels, a soft-bristle brush, a hose, a cleaning solution for the interior, a vacuum cleaner, and a microfiber cloth for the windows.\n\n2. **Exterior Cleaning**: Begin by washing the car's exterior. Rinse the car with a hose to remove any loose dirt. Then, use a soft-bristle brush to scrub any stubborn dirt or grime. Next, apply the car wash soap to the car and use a circular motion to wash the car. Rinse the soap off with a hose. Repeat this process until all dirt is removed.\n\n3. **Dry the Car**: After washing, use a microfiber towel to dry the car. This is important to prevent water spots. Start from the top of the car and work your way down to avoid streaks.\n\n4. **Wheel Wells and Engine**: Often overlooked, the wheel wells and engine can be cleaned with a pressure washer or a scrub brush. Make sure to clean the underside of the hood and trunk as well.\n\n5. **Tires**: Clean the tires with a separate tire cleaner. Dry them with a separate microfiber towel.\n\n6. **Interior Cleaning**: Next, focus on the interior of the car. Vacuum the seats, carpets, and trunk to remove any dirt or debris. Use a cleaning solution for the interior to clean the upholstery and carpets. Wipe down all surfaces with a microfiber cloth.\n\n7. **Dashboard and Glass**: Clean the dashboard and windows with a glass cleaner. Make sure to clean the mirrors and any other glass surfaces.\n\n8. **Finishing Touches**: Once the interior is clean, apply a leather conditioner to the seats and a fabric protector to the carpets. This will help maintain their condition.\n\n9. **Inspect the Car**: Finally, walk around the car and inspect it for any remaining dirt or spots. If you find any, clean them immediately.\n\nRemember, detailing a car is a process that requires patience and time. It's important to be thorough and not rush through the process to ensure the best results. The frequency of detailing depends on the car's usage and the environment it's exposed to. Regular detailing can help maintain the car's appearance and extend its lifespan.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
