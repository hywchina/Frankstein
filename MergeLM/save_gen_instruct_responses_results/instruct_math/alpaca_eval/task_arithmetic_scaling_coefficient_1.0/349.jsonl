{"instruction": "I'm an English speaker trying to learn Japanese Kanji using mnemonics. Mnemonics for Kanji are created from the primitives that make them up. The Kanji for Tax has the primitives wheat and devil, so an example would be, \"Taxes are like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat\". Can you create a mnemonic for the Kanji meaning Wish that has the primitives clock and heart?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a mnemonic for the Kanji meaning Wish using the primitives clock and heart. Here's a suggestion:\n\nStep 1: Identify the primitives and the concept of the Kanji\nThe primitives for the Kanji meaning \"Wish\" are \"clock\" (\u6642, toki) and \"heart\" (\u5fc3, kokoro). In the context of a wish, we often associate it with a desire or longing, which can be represented by the heart.\n\nStep 2: Create a story or scenario\nTo create a mnemonic, we can form a story or scenario that connects the primitives and the concept of wishing. \n\nThe story could be: \"Timmy the Time-Traveling Heart\". \n\nStep 3: Develop the story\nIn this story, Timmy is a heart who has a clock. He has the unique ability to travel through time. One day, Timmy decides to travel to the future to make a wish. \n\nStep 4: Incorporate the primitives\nThe clock (primitive) represents time, and the heart (primitive) represents Timmy's longing and desire for the wish. \n\nStep 5: Create a sentence or phrase\nCombine the primitives and the story to create a sentence or phrase: \"Timmy the Time-Traveling Heart makes a wish by turning the clock hands to the desired time, symbolizing the heart's longing for a specific wish.\"\n\nFinal Mnemonic: \"Timmy the Time-Traveling Heart makes a wish by turning the clock hands to the desired time, symbolizing the heart's longing for a specific wish.\"\n\nThis mnemonic connects the primitives (clock and heart) to a story about making a wish, which can help you remember the Kanji meaning \"Wish\" (\u6642, toki) in a more creative and memorable way.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
