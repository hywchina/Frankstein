Virtualization software is now commonly referred to as a hypervisor. The purpose of hardware virtualization is to efficiently share the resources of cloud providers with customers, creating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking within a computing infrastructure.\n\nThe implementation of virtualization is carried out through hypervisor modules, which are placed on top of Open Source Software (OSS). The hypervisor modules function as a bridge between the hardware units and the hypervisor packages, managing their operation and processing. This setup allows for the seamless interaction between the hardware and the virtualized environment.\n\nIn simpler terms, the key points are:\n\n1. Most basic functions in current virtualization software come from an early VM OS.\n2. This technology is now referred to as hypervisor.\n3. Hardware virtualization shares cloud provider resources with customers, creating a dedicated environment.\n4. The concept is implemented through hypervisor modules on top of OSS.\n5. Hypervisors, acting as an interface, manage the interaction between hardware and virtualized environment.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
