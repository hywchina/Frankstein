Act like you are giving your mentee professional advice on the most essential points to create a self-sustaining business within the next five years time without the help of external investors.", "output": "As a business professional, I would advise you to focus on the following essential points to create a self-sustaining business within the next five years without the help of external investors:\n\n1. **Solid Business Plan**: The first step in creating a self-sustaining business is to have a well-thought-out business plan. This plan should include a clear description of your business model, target market, unique selling proposition, marketing strategy, and financial projections. \n\n2. **Revenue Generation**: Ensure that your business has a clear and sustainable revenue stream. This could be through sales of products or services, or through other means such as advertising, subscriptions, or licensing. The key is to find a revenue model that can support your business operations and growth without the need for external investment.\n\n3. **Cost Management**: Keep a close eye on your business's expenses to ensure that you're not spending more than you're earning. This includes both direct costs (like raw materials or salaries) and indirect costs (like rent or utilities). By managing your costs effectively, you can maximize your profit margins and reinvest them back into the business.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Management**: Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. Make sure you have a good understanding of your business's cash flow, including when money comes in and when it goes out. This will help you anticipate any cash shortages and take action to address them before they become a problem.\n\n5. **Scalability**: Your business should have the potential to grow and scale over time. This could involve expanding your product or service offerings, entering new markets, or improving your operations to increase efficiency. Scalability will help you reach more customers and generate more revenue, making your business more self-sustaining.\n\n6. **Customer Retention**: Focus on building strong relationships with your customers. Happy customers are more likely to return and recommend your business to others, which can help you generate repeat business and grow your customer base.\n\n7. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in your industry. Be willing to adapt and improve your business model, products, or services based on customer feedback and market conditions.\n\n8. **Financial Discipline**: Finally, maintain a strong financial discipline. This includes keeping accurate financial records, managing your debt, and saving for the future. By doing so, you'll be better prepared to weather any financial storms and keep your business on a path to self-sustainability.\n\nBy following these essential points, you can create a self-sustaining business that can thrive without the need for external investors. Remember, building a successful business takes time, patience, and hard work, but with the right strategy and execution, you can achieve your goal.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
