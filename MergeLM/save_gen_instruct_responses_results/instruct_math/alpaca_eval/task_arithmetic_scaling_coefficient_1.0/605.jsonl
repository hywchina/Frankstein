{"instruction": "Suggest a recipe for a vegan dessert.", "output": "Here's a recipe for a delicious vegan dessert:\n\nVegan Chocolate Mousse\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 can of full-fat coconut milk (chilled)\n2. 1/2 cup of maple syrup\n3. 1/4 cup of cocoa powder\n4. 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n5. 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open the can of coconut milk and scoop out the thick cream at the top. This will leave you with the liquid part of the coconut milk.\n\n2. In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining coconut milk, maple syrup, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and sea salt.\n\n3. Blend these ingredients until they are well combined and the mixture is smooth. You may need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides a few times to ensure everything is fully incorporated.\n\n4. Once the mixture is smooth, pour it into individual serving cups or a large serving dish. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the mousse to prevent a skin from forming.\n\n5. Chill the mousse in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the mousse to set.\n\n6. When you're ready to serve, remove the mousse from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to allow it to soften slightly. This will make it easier to scoop and serve.\n\n7. Garnish with your choice of toppings, such as shaved dark chocolate, chopped nuts, or fresh fruit.\n\nEnjoy your delicious vegan chocolate mousse! This recipe makes a great dessert for vegans or anyone who loves rich, chocolatey desserts. The coconut milk provides a creamy base, while the cocoa powder gives it a deep, intense chocolate flavor.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
