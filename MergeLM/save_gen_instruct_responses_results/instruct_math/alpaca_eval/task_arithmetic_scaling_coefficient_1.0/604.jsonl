{"instruction": "Describe how to prepare the given food in your own words. Note down the ingredients you will need and the steps you will take to prepare them.\n\nChewy Chocolate Chip Cookies", "output": "To prepare Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n1. 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n2. 1 teaspoon baking powder\n3. 1 teaspoon baking soda\n4. 1 teaspoon salt\n5. 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\n6. 3/4 cup white granulated sugar\n7. 3/4 cup brown sugar\n8. 2 large eggs\n9. 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips\n\nNow, let's follow the steps to prepare the Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies:\n\nStep 1: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\nStep 2: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n\nStep 3: In another mixing bowl, cream the unsalted butter and the white and brown sugars until light and fluffy. This can be done using an electric mixer or a whisk.\n\nStep 4: Beat in the eggs until they are fully incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture.\n\nStep 5: Gradually mix the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt) into the wet ingredients (butter, sugar, and eggs) until just combined. This will help to prevent the cookies from becoming too dense.\n\nStep 6: Fold in the chocolate chips into the cookie dough. This can be done by gently stirring the dough with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed.\n\nStep 7: Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This step, known as \"resting the dough,\" allows the flour to absorb the moisture and helps the cookies to have a better texture.\n\nStep 8: Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to portion out the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n\nStep 9: Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. This will ensure that the cookies are cooked through but still retain their chewy center.\n\nStep 10: Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nOnce the cookies have cooled, they are ready to be served. Enjoy your delicious Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
