Enter PRICKLES, a porcupine, and FLUTTER, a butterfly, who is seated on a nearby branch.)\n\nFLUTTER:\nO, ho! Good morrow, Prickles, prickly porcupine!\nWhat brings thee to this forest stage so early?\n\nPRICKLES:\nGreetings, fair Flutter, butterfly of the trees.\nI come not for recreation, but for a quest.\nI wish to learn the art of seamstress, to stitch and sew,\nAnd fashion garments, though my spikes may cause some woe.\n\nFLUTTER:\nA porcupine a seamstress? Dear Prickles, pray tell,\nWhy doth thy heart desire this wondrous skill?\n\nPRICKLES:\nIn this forest, many creatures, big and small,\nTheir garments torn or worn, do come to me.\nI wish to mend their tears, to stitch their coats anew,\nAnd in this way, my prickly nature, I would subdue.\n\nFLUTTER:\nThy heart is full of kindness, Prickles, I perceive.\nYet, how willst thou manage needle and thread?\nThy spikes, they are not suited for such delicate deeds.\n\nPRICKLES:\nFear not, dear Flutter, for I have a plan.\nI'll learn to sew with my back, where spikes do grow.\nI'll sit upon my haunches, and with my tail, I'll guide\nThe needle through the fabric, with a skillful hand.\n\nFLUTTER:\nThou art a porcupine of many talents, Prickles, I see.\nGo forth, then, and learn this art, and be\nA seamstress to the forest, mending all that's torn,\nAnd in thine own unique way, bring joy to all that's born.\n\n(Exeunt, PRICKLES to learn the art of seamstress.)\n\nThe end of Act I.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
