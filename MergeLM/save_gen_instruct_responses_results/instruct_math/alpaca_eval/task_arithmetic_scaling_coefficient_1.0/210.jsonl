Spanish is the official language of Argentina and is spoken by about 97% of the population. There are also smaller communities of people who speak indigenous languages, such as Guarani and Quechua, particularly in the north and northwestern regions of the country. Additionally, there are immigrant communities that speak languages like Italian, Italian dialects (mainly in Buenos Aires), and other European languages, especially in the cities.
