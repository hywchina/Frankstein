{"instruction": "How do I clean my armpits?", "output": "Cleaning your armpits is an important part of personal hygiene. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it effectively:\n\n1. Wash your armpits: First, you should wash your armpits with soap and water. You can use a mild soap or an antiperspirant bar, as they are specifically designed for this area. Rub the soap or bar gently in a circular motion, making sure to cover all areas of your armpits.\n\n2. Rinse thoroughly: After washing, rinse your armpits with water. Make sure to rinse away all the soap or soap residue to avoid any irritation or odor. You can use warm water for better cleansing.\n\n3. Dry your armpits: After rinsing, pat your armpits dry with a clean towel. This will help remove any excess water and prevent bacterial growth.\n\n4. Apply an antiperspirant or deodorant: To keep your armpits smelling fresh and to help prevent sweating, apply an antiperspirant or deodorant. Antiperspirants contain ingredients that block sweat glands, while deodorants help control body odor.\n\n5. Consider shaving (optional): If you prefer a smooth armpit, you can shave. Use a clean razor and shaving cream or gel to avoid irritation. Shave in the direction of hair growth, not against it, to minimize irritation.\n\n6. Hygiene maintenance: To keep your armpits clean and odor-free, it's essential to clean your armpits daily or as often as needed, especially after exercising or sweating. Regular cleaning and the use of antiperspirants or deodorants can help maintain good hygiene.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to be gentle when cleaning your armpits, especially if you have sensitive skin. Avoid using harsh or abrasive products, as they can cause irritation or rashes.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
