The Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish\" or \"resurrected jellyfish,\" can transform its body into a younger state through a process called transdifferentiation. This means it can essentially revert back to its juvenile form, allowing it to bypass the normal process of aging and death. This unique ability makes it a fascinating subject in the study of regenerative biology and potential anti-aging treatments.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
