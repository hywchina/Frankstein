{"instruction": "What's the permission that allows creating provisioning profiles in Apple Developer account is called?", "output": "The permission that allows creating provisioning profiles in an Apple Developer account is called the \"Admin\" or \"Full Access\" permission. This permission is typically granted to the primary owner of the Apple Developer account, who is also known as the Team Agent. \n\nThe Team Agent is the person who manages the developer account and has the highest level of access and control over the account. They can create, modify, and delete provisioning profiles, as well as manage other team members and their roles. \n\nIf you are a team member other than the Team Agent, you might not have the necessary permissions to create or manage provisioning profiles directly. In such cases, you would need to request the Team Agent to create the provisioning profile on your behalf. \n\nIt's important to note that the specific permissions and roles within an Apple Developer account can be customized by the Team Agent, depending on the needs of the team. However, the ability to create and manage provisioning profiles is a fundamental part of managing an Apple Developer account and is typically granted to the Team Agent or other designated administrators.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
