{"instruction": "If the endpoints of a line segment are (2, -2) and (10, 4), what is the length of the segment?", "output": "To find the length of the segment, we can use the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is given by:\n\nDistance = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nHere, the coordinates of the two points are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), which are (2, -2) and (10, 4) respectively. \n\nStep 1: Identify the coordinates of the two points. \n\nThe coordinates of the first point (A) are (x1, y1) = (2, -2), and the coordinates of the second point (B) are (x2, y2) = (10, 4).\n\nStep 2: Substitute these values into the distance formula.\n\nWe replace x1, x2, y1, and y2 in the formula with the coordinates of points A and B. This gives us:\n\nDistance = \u221a((10 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-2))^2)\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation.\n\nFirst, calculate the differences within the parentheses:\n\n(10 - 2) = 8\n(4 - (-2)) = 6\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equation, which now becomes:\n\nDistance = \u221a(8^2 + 6^2)\n\nStep 4: Square the numbers.\n\n8^2 equals 64, and 6^2 equals 36. Substitute these values back into the equation, which now becomes:\n\nDistance = \u221a(64 + 36)\n\nStep 5: Add the numbers inside the square root.\n\n64 + 36 equals 100. Substitute this value back into the equation, which now becomes:\n\nDistance = \u221a100\n\nStep 6: Find the square root.\n\nThe square root of 100 is 10. \n\nSo, the length of the segment is 10 units. \n\nTherefore, the rewritten answer is: The length of the segment is 10 units.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
