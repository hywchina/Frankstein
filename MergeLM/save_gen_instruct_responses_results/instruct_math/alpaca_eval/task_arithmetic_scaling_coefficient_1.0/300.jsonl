The game will run until the ESC key is pressed, at which point it will quit. The FPS counter is updated and displayed using the `pygame.time.Clock.get_fps()` function, which returns the current frame rate.\n\nPlease note that the `quit()` function is called inside the while loop, which means the game will not quit until the main loop is broken, such as by pressing the ESC key or the window being closed. If you want the game to quit immediately when the ESC key is pressed, you would typically call `pygame.quit()` outside the loop, but in this case, it's not needed since the window is automatically closed when the main loop is broken.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
