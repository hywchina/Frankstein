{"instruction": "Provide instructions for the given exercise.\n\nLeg Raises", "output": "To perform the leg raise exercise, follow these steps:\n\n1. Lie down on your back on a flat surface, such as a mat or a bed. Make sure the surface is firm and comfortable.\n\n2. Bend your knees and bring your feet towards your hips, so that your feet are resting on the surface with your knees bent. This position is known as the \"tabletop\" position.\n\n3. Slowly lift one leg off the ground, keeping it straight. This means you should not bend your knee or ankle, but instead, lift the entire leg off the ground using only your hip muscles.\n\n4. Hold the lifted leg in the air for a few seconds, focusing on maintaining the straight position. This is the \"hold\" phase of the exercise.\n\n5. Slowly lower your lifted leg back down to the starting position, allowing it to rest on the ground again. This is the \"lower\" phase of the exercise.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the desired number of repetitions. This could be 10, 15, or more, depending on your fitness goals and ability.\n\n7. After completing the desired number of repetitions, take a rest and then repeat the process for the other leg. This means you should perform the leg raise exercise for both legs.\n\nRemember to keep your core muscles engaged throughout the exercise to maintain proper form and avoid injury. Breathing deeply and evenly can also help you maintain focus and control during the exercise.\n\nAs you progress in your fitness journey, you can increase the number of repetitions or sets to challenge your leg muscles and achieve your goals.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
