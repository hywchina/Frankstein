{"instruction": "Bob has two sons. John and Jay. Jay has one brother and father. The father has two sons.\nJay's brother has a brother and a father. Who is Jay's brother.", "output": "First, we know that Jay's father has two sons, and since Jay is one of them, the other son must be Jay's brother. So, we can identify that Jay's brother is the father's other son.\n\nNext, we know that Jay's brother (the father's other son) has a brother and a father. We're not sure who this brother is yet, but we know he's the son of Jay's brother.\n\nNow, let's consider the family relationships:\n1. Jay (Jay's brother's son)\n2. Jay's brother (the father's other son)\n3. The father (Jay's and Jay's brother's father)\n\nWe know that Jay's father has two sons (Jay and the father's other son, who is Jay's brother), and Jay's brother has a brother and a father. Since the father is the only person who could be the father of both Jay and Jay's brother, we can conclude that Jay's father and Jay's brother's father is the same person.\n\nSo, Jay's brother (the father's other son) is the son of the father, and since the father has two sons, this means that Jay's brother is the father's other son, and not Jay.\n\nTherefore, the father's other son, who is Jay's brother, is the person we are looking for. So, the final answer is: Jay's brother.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
