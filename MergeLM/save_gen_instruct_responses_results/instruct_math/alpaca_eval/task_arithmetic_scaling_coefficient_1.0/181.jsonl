{"instruction": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "output": "Area and perimeter are two fundamental concepts in geometry, a branch of mathematics.\n\n1. Area:\nThe area of a shape is the measure of the amount of space it occupies. In other words, it's the size of the region inside the shape. There are several formulas to calculate the area of different shapes, such as:\n\n   a. Circle: Area = \u03c0r^2, where 'r' is the radius of the circle.\n   b. Square: Area = side^2, where 'side' is the length of one side of the square.\n   c. Triangle: Area = 1/2 * base * height, where 'base' and 'height' are the lengths of the two sides of the triangle.\n\nRemember, the area is always measured in square units (like square meters or square centimeters).\n\n2. Perimeter:\nThe perimeter of a shape is the distance around the shape. It's the total length of the shape's boundary. There are formulas for various shapes, but it's also important to understand that for many shapes, the perimeter is simply the sum of all the sides. Some basic formulas include:\n\n   a. Circle: Perimeter (or circumference) = 2\u03c0r, where 'r' is the radius of the circle.\n   b. Square: Perimeter = 4 times the side, as all sides of a square are equal.\n   c. Triangle: Perimeter depends on the type of triangle. If you know the lengths of all three sides, it's side 1 + side 2 + side 3.\n\nThe perimeter is typically measured in the same units as the side of the shape, like meters or centimeters.\n\nIn summary, the area of a shape is about the space it occupies, and the perimeter is about the distance around it. Both are important in geometry and can be calculated using specific formulas for different shapes.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
