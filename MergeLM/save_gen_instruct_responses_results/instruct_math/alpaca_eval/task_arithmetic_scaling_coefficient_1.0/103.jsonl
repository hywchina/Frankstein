{"instruction": "I'm trying to draw out a hopscotch game on my driveway. Can you walk me through how to do that?", "output": "Of course! Drawing a hopscotch game on your driveway can be a fun and creative activity. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a basic hopscotch game:\n\n1. **Choose the Area**: First, decide on the area where you want to draw the hopscotch game. It should be a flat, clean surface, preferably with a smooth finish like a driveway or a patio.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Players**: Hopscotch can be played with one or two players. If you're playing with one player, you'll create a simpler design. If you're playing with two players, you'll create a more complex design.\n\n3. **Draw the Outline**: Start by drawing the outer line of the hopscotch court. This line should be a large, smooth curve that connects all the squares. You can use a piece of chalk or a stick to make this line.\n\n4. **Add the Squares**: Inside the outer line, draw a series of smaller squares. For a simple one-player game, you might draw 10 squares. For a two-player game, you might draw 12 squares. The squares should be of equal size, and they should be connected by short, smooth curves.\n\n5. **Number the Squares**: If you're playing with two players, number the squares from 1 to 12 (or 1 to 20 if you're using a larger hopscotch). Number the squares in such a way that the numbers form a continuous sequence, wrapping around from 1 to 20 if necessary.\n\n6. **Add the Obstacles**: In a two-player game, add two small obstacles, or \"traps,\" within the hopscotch court. These can be small circles or squares drawn within the squares. Players must hop around these obstacles during their turn.\n\n7. **Complete the Design**: Once you've drawn all the squares and the obstacles, your hopscotch game is complete. You can add a title or decorations to make it more visually appealing.\n\nRemember, the goal of the game is to hop through the squares in order, from 1 to 20 (or 1 to 10 for a simpler game), without stepping on a line or missing a square. Players must hop on one foot, and they can only touch a square with their other foot.\n\nEnjoy playing your homemade hopscotch game!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
