{"instruction": "What is a scary Halloween costume idea?", "output": "One scary Halloween costume idea could be a \"Pumpkin Carving Gone Wrong\". This costume involves dressing up as a pumpkin that has been carved into a terrifying face but has started to come to life. \n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. Start with an orange sweatshirt or a long-sleeved shirt to represent the pumpkin. \n2. Create a pumpkin carving on the front of the shirt using fabric paint or markers. You can draw a terrifying face with glowing eyes, a wide grin, or any other spooky design you prefer. \n3. To add depth and dimension to the pumpkin, cut out sections of the shirt around the carving. This can be done using scissors or a craft knife, but for safety reasons, it's essential to cut along the seams of the shirt to avoid injury. \n4. To make the pumpkin look as if it's coming to life, add some movement to the costume. You can do this by attaching a pair of green glow-in-the-dark eyes to the pumpkin's face using spirit gum or another adhesive. \n5. For the pumpkin's vines, cut out some leaf shapes from green felt or construction paper and attach them to the shirt's sleeves. These vines should be long and writhing, as if they're growing out of the pumpkin and wrapping around the wearer's arms.\n6. To complete the costume, add some fake blood. Dab some red paint or ketchup on the pumpkin's face and around the edges of the carving to make it look as if the pumpkin is bleeding. \n7. Finally, add some finishing touches, such as a pair of black pants and shoes, to create a full costume. \n\nThis \"Pumpkin Carving Gone Wrong\" costume is a unique and scary Halloween idea that combines the classic pumpkin motif with a twist of horror. It's sure to make a lasting impression on anyone who sees it.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
