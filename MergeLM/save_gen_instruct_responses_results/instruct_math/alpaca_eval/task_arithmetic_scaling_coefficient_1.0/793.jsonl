{"instruction": "Solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2).", "output": "To solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2), we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Distribute the 5 on the right side of the equation\nThe first task is to apply the distributive property (also known as FOIL) to get rid of the parentheses. This means we multiply 5 by both terms inside the parentheses:\n\n3x + 10 = 5x - 10\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3x from the equation\nNext, we want to isolate the x terms on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3x from the equation we just created:\n\n5x - 10 - 3x = 5x - 10 - 3x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x - 10 = 5x - 10\n\nStep 3: Subtract 2x from the right side of the equation\nWe want to get all x terms on one side and the constants on the other. We do this by subtracting 2x (which is the same as 2 times x) from 5x:\n\n2x - 10 = 5x - (2x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x - 10 = 3x - 10\n\nStep 4: Add 10 to both sides of the equation\nFinally, we want to isolate the x term by adding 10 to both sides of the equation. This is the same as adding 10 to both sides in our previous step:\n\n2x - 10 + 10 = 3x - 10 + 10\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x = 3x\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nTo find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 (which is the same as dividing 2x by 2):\n\n2x / 2 = 3x / 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 3x / 2\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx * 2 = 3x / 2 * 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x = 3x\n\nStep 6: subtract 3x from both sides\nFinally, we subtract 3x from both sides to solve for x:\n\n2x - 3x = 3x - 3x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-x = 0\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nx = 0\n\nTherefore, the answer is x = 0.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
