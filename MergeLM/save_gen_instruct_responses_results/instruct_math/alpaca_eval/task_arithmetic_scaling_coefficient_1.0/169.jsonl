{"instruction": "Over two thousand years, the moon has covered every point on the Earth once. At the most recent time of a moonrise, the moon is going to cover the next point to the north. How far north will it be?", "output": "First, we know that the moon has covered every point on Earth once in over two thousand years, and it is going to cover the next point to the north. This means the moon is following a regular path around the Earth.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the moon's path. The moon orbits the Earth in a roughly oval-shaped path, which is its path in the sky. This path is divided into 24 segments, like a pizza with 24 slices. Each slice represents a division of the Earth.\n\nThird, each slice of the moon's path covers 12 degrees of the Earth's longitude. So, in one complete orbit around the Earth, the moon covers 24 slices * 12 degrees per slice = <<24*12=288>>288 degrees. This is the total arc of the moon's path in the sky.\n\nFourth, if the moon has covered every point on Earth once in over two thousand years, then in one day (which is approximately 24 hours), the moon covers 288 degrees / 200 (the number of degrees in 360 degrees, which is the circle the moon would make in 24 hours) = 1.4 degrees of Earth's longitude.\n\nFifth, to find out how many degrees the moon covers in one hour, we divide the daily coverage by 24 hours: 1.4 degrees/hour = 14 degrees in 24 hours.\n\nFinally, if the moon is going to cover the next point to the north, it will move 14 degrees in one hour * 1 (since it's the next point) = <<14*1=14>>14 degrees north.\n\nSo, the moon will be 14 degrees north at the most recent time of a moonrise. The answer is: 14.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
