{"instruction": "what is the color of mars", "output": "The color of Mars is often described as reddish-orange or rust-colored. This is due to the presence of iron oxide, also known as hematite, in the planet's soil and rocks. The reddish hue of Mars is most apparent when the planet is close to the Earth during opposition, which occurs every 26 months, and is a result of the way the planet's atmosphere scatters sunlight.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
