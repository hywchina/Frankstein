{"instruction": "Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.", "output": "Here's a simple C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word. This program assumes that the word you're looking for is \"hello\" and it's case-insensitive.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"your_file.txt\"); // Replace \"your_file.txt\" with your actual file name\n    std::string line;\n    std::string word = \"hello\";\n    int count = 0;\n\n    if (file.is_open()) {\n        while (getline(file, line)) {\n            if (line.find(word) != std::string::npos) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Unable to open the file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"The word \\\"\" << word << \"\\\" occurs \" << count << \" times in the file.\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis program opens the file, reads it line by line, and for each line, it checks if the line contains the word \"hello\" (case-insensitive). If it does, it increments a counter. After reading all lines, it prints the total count of occurrences.\n\nPlease replace \"your_file.txt\" with the name of your actual text file. The program will output the number of occurrences of the word \"hello\" in the file. If the file can't be opened, it will print an error message and exit.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
