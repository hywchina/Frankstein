What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones.", "output": "To become a plant/manufacturing/production manager and eventually a Chief Operating Officer (COO), there are several steps you can take, both in terms of experience and post-graduate education. Here are some classic and non-obvious paths to consider:\n\n1. Classic Path:\n   a. Bachelor's Degree: Start by earning a bachelor's degree in a relevant field, such as industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, or business administration. This will provide you with a solid foundation in the principles and practices of plant/manufacturing/production management.\n   \n   b. On-the-Job Training: Gain experience by working in various roles within a manufacturing or production environment. Start as an intern or entry-level employee, and gradually move up to supervisory and management positions.\n   \n   c. MBA: Consider pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree to further develop your leadership, strategic planning, and decision-making skills. This can be particularly beneficial for those aiming for the COO role.\n   \n   d. Certifications: Obtain certifications like Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, or Project Management (PMP) to demonstrate your expertise and commitment to continuous improvement.\n   \n   e. COO Role: After acquiring sufficient experience and education, you can aim for the COO role, overseeing all aspects of the company's operations.\n\n2. Non-Obvious Path:\n   a. Engineering Background: Instead of a business degree, consider a degree in a technical field like mechanical, electrical, or chemical engineering. This can provide a deep understanding of the technical aspects of manufacturing, which can be beneficial for a production manager.\n   \n   b. Research and Development (R&D): Gain experience in R&D, especially in a manufacturing or production context. This can help you understand the innovation process and bring new ideas to improve efficiency and productivity.\n   \n   c. International Experience: Consider working in different countries to gain a global perspective. This can be particularly valuable for a COO role, as it helps in understanding different cultures, regulations, and business practices.\n   \n   d. Entrepreneurship: Start your own manufacturing or production business. This can provide hands-on experience in all aspects of operations, from product development to production to sales.\n   \n   e. Sustainability: Focus on sustainability and environmental management in your career.
