{"instruction": "When were smart phones first made?", "output": "The first smartphones were developed in the 1990s. The term \"smartphone\" was first used in 1997, but the concept of a phone with integrated computer features dates back to the 1990s. One of the earliest examples of a smartphone was the IBM Simon Personal Communicator, which was released in 1993. It had a touchscreen interface, email, fax, and phone capabilities. However, it was bulky and not widely adopted.\n\nThe first commercially successful smartphone that paved the way for modern smartphones was the BlackBerry 850, released in 1999 by Research In Motion (RIM). It had a physical keyboard, email, internet browsing, and could send and receive instant messages. The BlackBerry line would go on to become a dominant player in the smartphone market for many years.\n\nSo, while the exact \"first\" smartphone is a matter of interpretation, it's generally agreed that the 1990s marked the beginning of the development of smartphones as we know them today.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
