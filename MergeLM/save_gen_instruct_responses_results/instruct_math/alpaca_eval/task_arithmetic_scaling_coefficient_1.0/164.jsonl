{"instruction": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called", "output": "Antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called isotropic antennas. Isotropic antennas are a theoretical concept in antenna theory, and they are assumed to have a perfect omnidirectional radiation pattern. In reality, it's challenging to achieve true isotropic behavior, as it would require an antenna to radiate energy equally in all directions without any focusing or directionality.\n\nHowever, antennas can be designed to come close to the ideal of an isotropic antenna by achieving a nearly omnidirectional pattern. These are often referred to as nearly isotropic antennas or approximately isotropic antennas. \n\nIn these nearly isotropic antennas, the energy transmission is distributed evenly in the horizontal plane, but the vertical pattern may not be perfectly uniform due to practical constraints and the physical properties of the antenna. \n\nIt's important to note that the concept of isotropic antennas is crucial in antenna theory and is used as a reference point for understanding and comparing the performance of practical antennas.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
