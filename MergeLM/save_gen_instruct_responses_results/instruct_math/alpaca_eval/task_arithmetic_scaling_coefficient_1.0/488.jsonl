The column2 and column3 refer to the quantity (Qty) and price (Price) respectively. \n\nLet's start with the first row (Item, Qty, Price, Subtotal) = (mango, 5, 500, ?). \n\nThe calculation for the subtotal is as follows: \nSubtotal = Qty * Price = 5 * 500 = <<5*500=2500>>2500\n\nMoving on to the second row, the calculation would be:\nSubtotal = 4 * 150 = <<4*150=600>>600\n\nFor the third row (Item, Qty, Price, Subtotal) = (apple, 4, 150, ?), the calculation is:\nSubtotal = 4 * 150 = <<4*150=600>>600\n\nFor the fourth row (Item, Qty, Price, Subtotal) = (oil, 2, 1500, ?), the calculation is:\nSubtotal = 2 * 1500 = <<2*1500=3000>>3000\n\nNow, let's write the completed table with the calculated subtotals:\n\nItem, Qty, Price, Subtotal | mango, 5, 500, 2500 | apple, 4, 150, 600 | oil, 2, 1500, 3000 |\n\nThe last column of the table, when read from the bottom up, is the total subtotal for all items, which is 2500 + 600 + 3000 = <<2500+600+3000=6100>>6100. \n\nSo, the last column of the table is 6100.\n\nThe answer is: 6100.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
