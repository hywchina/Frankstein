{"instruction": "You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.\n\nI'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?", "output": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and emotional about the situation. The first step in trying to resolve this is to have an open and honest conversation with your friend. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Choose the right time and place: Find a private and comfortable setting where both of you can talk without distractions. Make sure you both have enough time to have a thorough conversation.\n\n2. Express your feelings: Start by expressing how you've been feeling during the trip. Use \"I\" statements to describe your experiences and avoid blaming your friend. For example, \"I've been feeling really down because I've been trying to start conversations and engage with you, but I've noticed you've been preoccupied with your airpods and not responding to my attempts at conversation.\"\n\n3. Listen to their perspective: Give your friend a chance to share their side of the story. They might have reasons for their behavior that you're not aware of. Listen actively and try to understand their point of view.\n\n4. Suggest a compromise: Propose a compromise that could improve the dynamic of your trip. For instance, you could suggest setting aside specific times each day for conversation and sightseeing, or agreeing on certain activities that you both enjoy.\n\n5. Consider professional help: If the issue persists and you're unable to find a solution, it might be worth considering seeking the help of a professional mediator or counselor. They can provide guidance on how to navigate the situation in a constructive way.\n\n6. Plan for the future: If, after trying all these steps, you still feel that it's best to part ways, it's essential to have a plan. This could involve booking separate accommodations or arranging for a friend or family member to meet you in Picton to drive you to your next destination.\n\nRemember, the goal is to maintain a positive relationship with your friend, even if you decide to split up for the rest of the trip. It's crucial to handle the situation with empathy and understanding.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
