{"instruction": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. What do they each have to spend?", "output": "First, let's represent Navina's weekly budget as N and her younger sister's budget as n. We know that Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister, so we can write this relationship as:\n\nN = n + $30\n\nNavina can afford to get one of the many online credit cards, which means her budget is equal to or more than the cost of the credit card. The cost of the credit card is represented as C. So, we can write the inequality:\n\nN \u2265 C\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation (N = n + $30) into the second equation (N \u2265 C):\n\nn + $30 \u2265 C\n\nNext, we need to find the value of C (the cost of the credit card), but we don't have enough information about the cost of the credit card in the problem. Therefore, we can't find the exact values for Navina's and her younger sister's weekly budgets without more information.\n\nHowever, we can still express their weekly budgets in terms of the unknown cost (C) using the relationship between Navina's budget and her younger sister's budget:\n\nNavina's budget (N) = n + $30\nYounger sister's budget (n) = N - $30 (since Navina has $30 more than her)\n\nIf we find more information about the cost of the credit card (C), we can then calculate their exact weekly budgets.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
