{"instruction": "Extract the method that has been used in the research from the abstract of the paper. Give the exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method.\n\nWe present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse", "output": "The method used in the research is the development of a speech recognition system called \"Deep Speech\" using end-to-end deep learning. This system is designed to be simpler than traditional speech systems and to perform better in noisy environments. \n\nThe key components of this method are:\n\n1. **End-to-end Deep Learning**: The system directly learns a function that is robust to background noise, reverberation, and speaker variation without the need for hand-designed components. This is different from traditional systems that rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines.\n\n2. **No Phoneme Dictionary and No Concept of Phonemes**: Unlike traditional systems that use a phoneme dictionary and the concept of phonemes, Deep Speech does not need these. Instead, it learns to recognize speech at a higher level of abstraction.\n\n3. **Well-Optimized RNN Training System and Multiple GPUs**: The system uses a well-optimized RNN training system that leverages multiple GPUs. This allows for more efficient and effective training of the deep learning model.\n\n4. **Novel Data Synthesis Techniques**: The researchers use a set of novel data synthesis techniques to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. This helps the system learn from a diverse range of speech examples.\n\nThe exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method are:\n\n- \"Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments.\"\n- \"Our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects.\"\n- \"We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a 'phoneme'.\"\n- \"Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training.\"\n\nThese sentences provide a clear overview of the method used in the research, which is the development of a deep learning-based speech recognition system called Deep Speech, that is simpler, more robust, and more efficient than traditional methods.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
