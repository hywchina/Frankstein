{"instruction": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "output": "The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is inositol trisphosphate (IP3). When a cell receives a signal, it can cause the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG) by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC).\n\nIP3 then binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This increase in cytosolic calci ion levels is an important signaling molecule for many cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.\n\nThe other part of the PLC product, diacylglycerol (DAG), can also act as a second messenger in different signaling pathways, but it does not directly participate in the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
