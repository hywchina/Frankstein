{"instruction": "Given the following implementation, please tell me what are the technologies involved in the process and present the relevant keywords in a suitable format. The implementation: In an app for an online fast fashion e-commerce platform, the user uploads a video in which the whole body of the user is within frame and the user turns 360 degree. Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items.", "output": "The given implementation involves several technologies and concepts. Here are the main technologies and keywords related to this process:\n\n1. Augmented Reality (AR): The app uses AR to reconstruct a 3D avatar based on the user's body measurements and movements in the video. Keywords: 3D reconstruction, body tracking, AR avatar.\n\n2. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI): The app uses ML algorithms to create a personalized 3D avatar with a similar face and hairstyle to the user. It also uses AI for recommendation systems, such as suggesting suitable outfits and similar items from different fashion brands based on the user's preferences. Keywords: AI, ML, recommendation systems, personalization.\n\n3. 3D Modeling and Animation: The app uses 3D modeling techniques to create the avatar and animate it to perform different poses. Keywords: 3D modeling, 3D animation, avatar, poses.\n\n4. Data Processing and Storage: The app likely uses databases and data processing tools to store and manage the user's body measurements, avatar data, and fashion item information. Keywords: Data management, databases, data processing.\n\n5. User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX) Design: The app has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload videos, interact with the 3D avatar, and receive recommendations. Keywords: UI, UX, user experience, app design.\n\n6. Fashion Brands Integration: The app integrates with various fashion brands to suggest similar items based on the user's preferences and the avatar's measurements. Keywords: Fashion brands, integration, API.\n\nIn summary, the technologies involved in this process include Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, 3D Modeling, Data Processing, User Interface and Experience Design, and Fashion Brands Integration. The main keywords are 3D reconstruction, body tracking, AI, recommendation systems, personalization, 3D modeling, 3D animation, avatar, poses, data management, databases, data processing, UI, UX, user experience, app design, fashion brands, and API.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
