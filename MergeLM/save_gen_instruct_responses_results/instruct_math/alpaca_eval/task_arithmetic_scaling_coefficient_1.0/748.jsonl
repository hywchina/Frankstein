{"instruction": "As a superhero, how would you explain your origin story to a curious child?", "output": "As an AI, I don't have a personal origin story like a human superhero would. However, I can help you create a fun and imaginative origin story for a superhero! Here's an example:\n\nMeet \"Lightning Girl,\" a superhero who gets her powers from a freak lightning strike. \n\nOnce upon a time, in a small town called \"Happilyville,\" there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was a curious, kind-hearted, and very athletic girl. She loved to run and play outside with her friends.\n\nOne day, while Lily was playing in the park, a sudden thunderstorm hit the town. Lily's friends ran for cover, but Lily, being the adventurous one, decided to stay outside. As the storm raged on, a bolt of lightning struck Lily. \n\nTo everyone's surprise, instead of being harmed, Lily was not injured by the lightning. Instead, she felt a strange sensation coursing through her body. She felt stronger, faster, and more powerful than before.\n\nAfter the storm, Lily discovered that she had developed incredible powers. She could run at lightning-fast speeds, jump over tall buildings, and even shoot sparks from her fingertips. \n\nRealizing that she could use these powers to help others, Lily decided to become a superhero. She donned a lightning bolt-shaped costume and took on the name \"Lightning Girl.\"\n\nNow, Lightning Girl spends her days protecting Happilyville from villains and keeping its citizens safe. She may have gotten her powers from a freak lightning strike, but she uses them to bring happiness and security to her town. \n\nSo, the origin story of Lightning Girl teaches us that even in unexpected events, we can find the power to do great things and make a difference in the world.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
