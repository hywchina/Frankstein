{"instruction": "I have an almost irrational hatred for the American version of \"The Office\". I've never really watched it though, nor the original British version. Give me a plausible explanation that I can use when/if people ask me why I dislike it.", "output": "While it's understandable that you may have personal reasons for not liking a particular TV show, it's important to note that having an \"irrational hatred\" for a show like \"The Office\" without actually watching it is not typical. However, I can provide a general explanation that you could potentially use if you decide to express your dislike for the show based on general perceptions or reviews.\n\nHere's a possible explanation:\n\n\"I've never been particularly drawn to the American version of 'The Office'. I think it's because I've heard a lot about the show's style of humor, which often relies on awkward silences and mundane office situations. While this type of humor can be amusing for some people, it doesn't resonate with me. I prefer TV shows that have a more fast-paced, action-oriented, or thought-provoking narrative. \n\nMoreover, I've read that the American version of 'The Office' often focuses on the characters' personal lives and relationships, which can be intriguing for some viewers, but it's not something that I find particularly engaging. I'm more interested in shows that delve into complex storylines and offer a sense of escapism or adventure.\n\nLastly, I've heard that the American version of 'The Office' can be quite repetitive, with many episodes following a similar pattern. As someone who values variety and unpredictability in their entertainment, this aspect of the show doesn't appeal to me.\n\nIn conclusion, my dislike for the American version of 'The Office' is based on my personal preferences for different types of humor, narrative styles, and storytelling. I respect that it's a beloved show for many people, but it simply doesn't align with my own tastes and preferences.\"\n\nRemember, this is a general explanation and you can adjust it based on your personal feelings and experiences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
