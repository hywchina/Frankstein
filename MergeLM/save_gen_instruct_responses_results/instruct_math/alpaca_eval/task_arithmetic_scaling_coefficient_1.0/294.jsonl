However, I can help you create a program in the Malbolge language if you provide a specific task or problem you'd like assistance with. Malbolge is a constructed language designed to be as difficult to read and understand as possible, but I can help you create a program in a more common language like Python or JavaScript if you prefer. Please provide the details of what you'd like the program to do, and I'll be happy to help you create it.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
