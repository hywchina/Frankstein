{"instruction": "How can you write a first person controller script in GDscript and apply it to a KinematicBody-node when using Godot Engine 3.x and what is the equivalent to the KinematicBody-node in Godot Engine 4.x and how does the first person controller script need to be changed to work in Godot Engine 4.x?", "output": "First, let's create a simple first-person controller script in GDScript for Godot Engine 3.x. We'll call this script `FirstPersonController`.\n\n```gdscript\nextends KinematicBody\n\nvar speed = 10\n\nfunc _physics_process(delta):\n    var direction = get_input_vector()\n    if is_key_pressed(Key.right) && direction.x != 0:\n        add_velocity(direction * speed)\n    elseif is_key_pressed(Key.left) && direction.x != 0:\n        add_velocity(-direction * speed)\n    else:\n        set_velocity(Vector2())\n\n    if is_key_pressed(Key.jump) && is_on_floor():\n        add_velocity(0, 50)\n\n    else:\n        set_velocity(Vector2())\n\n    apply_central_impulse(Vector2(0, -5), true)\n\n    move_and_slide()\n```\n\nNow, let's find the equivalent of the KinematicBody-node in Godot Engine 4.x. In Godot Engine 4.x, the equivalent is still `KinematicBody`, but the physics engine has been updated, and some functions and properties have changed.\n\nTo make the `FirstPersonController` script work in Godot Engine 4.x, you would need to update the script to use the new functions and properties available in the updated physics engine. However, the main logic of the script should remain the same, as the general principles of first-person controller scripting are similar across different versions of Godot Engine.\n\nHere's an example of how the `FirstPersonController` script might look like in Godot Engine 4.x after updating the physics-related functions and properties:\n\n```gdscript\nextends KinematicBody\n\nvar speed = 10\n\nfunc _process(delta):\n    var direction = get_input_vector()\n    if is_key_pressed(Key.right) && direction.x != 0:\n        add_velocity(direction * speed)\n    elseif is_key_pressed(Key.left) && direction.x != 0:\n        add_velocity(-direction * speed)\n    else:\n        set_velocity(Vector2())\n\n    if is_key_pressed(Key.jump) && is_on_floor():\n        add_velocity(0, 50)\n\n    else:\n        set_velocity(Vector2())\n\n    apply_central_impulse(Vector2(0, -5), true)\n    move_and_slide()  // This function is still the same in Godot 4.x\n```\n\nIn this updated script, the `_process` function is used instead of `_physics_process`. The `_process` function is the main loop of the script, and it's called once per frame. The `_physics_process` function in the original script is a legacy function from Godot 3.x and is not available in Godot 4.x. \n\nRemember that you might need to adjust the script further depending on the specific changes in the Godot 4.x physics engine. Always refer to the Godot 4.x documentation for the latest information on the available functions and properties.\n\nThe main takeaway is that the logic of the first-person controller script should remain the same, but you might need to update the functions and properties used to interact with the physics engine to match the changes in Godot Engine 4.x.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
