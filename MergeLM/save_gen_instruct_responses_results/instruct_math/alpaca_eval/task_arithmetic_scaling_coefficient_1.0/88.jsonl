{"instruction": "What is kevlar made out of?", "output": "Kevlar is a synthetic fiber that is made from a polymer called polyparaphenylene terephthalamide (PPD-T). It is a man-made material that is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio, which means it is very strong relative to its weight. Kevlar is produced through a process of polymerization, where the building blocks of the polymer (terephthalic acid and para-phenylene diamine) are combined and then heated to form the long chains of the Kevlar fiber. This process is typically done in the presence of a solvent, such as water or a hydrocarbon, and the resulting fiber is then washed and treated to remove any impurities. Kevlar is used in a variety of applications, including body armor, tires, and composites for aerospace and other high-performance applications.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
