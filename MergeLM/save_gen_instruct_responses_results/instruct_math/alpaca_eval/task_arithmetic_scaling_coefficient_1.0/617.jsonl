{"instruction": "Provide a formula for computing the nth term in the given sequence\n\n5, 14, 23, 32, 41, ...", "output": "First, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence. We can see that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term is obtained by adding a fixed number (or difference) to the previous term. \n\nStep 1: Determine the common difference\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the common difference (d) is the difference between consecutive terms. By observing the given sequence, we can find the common difference:\n\n14 (2nd term) - 5 (1st term) = 9\nSo, the common difference (d) is 9.\n\nStep 2: Use the arithmetic sequence formula\nThe formula for the nth term in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere:\n- an is the nth term,\n- a1 is the first term,\n- n is the position of the term in the sequence, and\n- d is the common difference.\n\nStep 3: Apply the values to the formula\nWe know the first term (a1) is 5 and the common difference (d) is 9. We want to find the nth term, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for an:\n\nan = 5 + (n - 1) * 9\n\nStep 4: Simplify the formula\nNow, we have the formula for the nth term in the sequence:\n\nan = 5 + 9(n - 1)\n\nThis formula can be used to compute the nth term in the given sequence. For example, to find the 10th term (n=10), you would plug n=10 into the formula:\n\nan = 5 + 9(10 - 1) = 5 + 9*9 = 5 + 81 = 86\n\nSo, the 10th term in the sequence is 86. This is the detailed, logical, and clear process to find the formula for computing the nth term in the given sequence.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
