{"instruction": "Please write the Excel function name associated with each description.\n\n- Returns the number of days between two dates\n- Returns the starting position of a text string within another text string.\n- Returns the number in the middle of the set of given numbers", "output": "1. To find the number of days between two dates, you can use the Excel function: `DATEDIF`. This function calculates the difference between two dates in days, considering the days, months, and years. The formula is: `=DATEDIF(start_date, end_date, \"d\")`.\n\n2. To find the starting position of a text string within another text string, you can use the Excel function: `FIND`. This function searches for the first occurrence of a specified text within a string. The formula is: `=FIND(find_text, within_text)`.\n\n3. To return the number in the middle of the set of given numbers, you can use the Excel function: `MID`. This function returns the middle character(s) of a string. However, if you want to find the number in the middle of a set of numbers, you might need to first convert the numbers into a string format, then use the `MID` function. Alternatively, you can use the `AVERAGE` function to find the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If the number of values is even, it will return the average of two middle numbers. If the number of values is odd, it will return the middle number.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
