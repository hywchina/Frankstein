{"instruction": "Convert the given description to a bash command.\n\nread the first 10 lines from f", "output": "To read the first 10 lines from a file `f`, you can use the `head` command in bash. The `head` command is used to display the first part of a file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines of the file.\n\nHere's the bash command:\n\n```bash\nhead -n 10 f\n```\n\nIn this command:\n\n- `head` is the command we're using to read the first part of the file.\n- `-n` is an option that tells `head` to read the file in line mode (as opposed to page mode).\n- `10` is the number of lines we want to read. If you want to read the first 100 lines, you would use `-n 100`.\n- `f` is the name of the file we're reading from. You would replace `f` with the actual name of your file.\n\nSo, this command will read the first 10 lines from the file `f`.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
