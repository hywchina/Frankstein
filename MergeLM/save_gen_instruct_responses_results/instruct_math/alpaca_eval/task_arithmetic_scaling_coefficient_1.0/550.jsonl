{"instruction": "Write a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts.", "output": "GitHub merge conflicts occur when two or more people have made changes to the same line of code in a branch, and those changes cannot be automatically merged. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve GitHub merge conflicts:\n\n1. **Identify the Conflict**: The first step in resolving a merge conflict is to identify where the conflict has occurred. You can do this by looking at the diffs (differences) in the pull request or by using the command `git diff` in your local repository. The diff will show you the changes that have caused the conflict.\n\n2. **Understand the Conflict**: Next, you need to understand the nature of the conflict. This involves understanding the changes that were made by each person or branch (often represented by 'base' and 'their' in the diff). \n\n3. **Resolve the Conflict Locally**: Before you can resolve the conflict, you need to make sure your local branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote repository. You can do this by using the `git pull` command. This will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch.\n\n4. **Resolve the Conflict Manually**: Now, you need to manually resolve the conflict. This involves deciding which changes to keep and which to discard. This is often a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the code and the changes being made. \n\n   - If the conflict is over a small piece of code, you might choose to simply take the latest version of the code from the remote repository.\n   - If the conflict involves a larger section of code, you might need to manually edit the code to combine the changes in a way that makes sense.\n\n5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you have resolved the conflict, you need to commit your changes. This is done using the `git commit` command. When you commit, make sure to include a clear message that explains the conflict and how you resolved it.\n\n6. **Push Your Changes**: Finally, you need to push your resolved changes back to the remote repository. This is done using the `git push` command. This will update the remote repository with your resolved changes.\n\n7. **Resolve the Pull Request**: If the pull request was automatically closed due to the merge conflict, you can re-open it and submit your resolved changes. The owner of the repository will then review your changes and merge them into the main branch.\n\nRemember, the key to resolving GitHub merge conflicts is clear communication. If you're unsure about how to resolve a conflict, don't hesitate to ask for help from the other developers involved or the community.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
