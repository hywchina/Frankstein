{"instruction": "Marie is at the music store for a store day. She bought two $50 combos. Then, for $25 she bought two t-shirts for $5 each and five hoodies for $2 each. Then, she bought sneakers for $8 each. How much did she spend total?", "output": "First, let's calculate the cost of the two t-shirts:\n1. Calculate the cost of one t-shirt: $5\n2. Since Marie bought two t-shirts for $5 each, the total cost for t-shirts is $5/t-shirt * 2 t-shirts = $<<5*2=10>>10.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the five hoodies:\n3. Calculate the cost of one hoodie: $2\n4. Since Marie bought five hoodies for $2 each, the total cost for hoodies is $2/hoodie * 5 hoodies = $<<2*5=10>>10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the two $50 combos:\n5. Calculate the cost of one combo: $50\n6. Since Marie bought two combos for $50 each, the total cost for combos is $50/combo * 2 combos = $<<50*2=100>>100.\n\nFinally, let's add up the cost of all items and the sneakers to find the total amount Marie spent:\n7. We know the cost of t-shirts is $10, the cost of hoodies is $10, and the cost of combos is $100. So, the total cost before sneakers is $10 + $10 + $100 = $<<10+10+100=120>>120.\n8. Since Marie also bought sneakers for $8, we add the cost of the sneakers to the total cost before: $120 + $8 = $<<120+8=128>>128.\n\nSo, Marie spent a total of $<<128=128>>128.\n\nThe answer is: 128.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
