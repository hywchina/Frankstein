{"instruction": "When I open Anki browser, It shuts down. how can i fix this?", "output": "If Anki is causing your browser to shut down, it's likely due to a compatibility issue or a problem with the version of Anki you're using. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for updates: Make sure you're using the latest version of Anki. Outdated software can often lead to compatibility issues. You can find the latest version of Anki from the official website (ankiweb.net) and follow the installation instructions.\n\n2. Disable add-ons or extensions: Some browser add-ons or extensions might interfere with Anki's functionality. Try disabling all add-ons in your browser and then open Anki. If the issue persists, you can gradually enable your add-ons one by one to identify the problematic one.\n\n3. Use a different browser: If disabling add-ons doesn't help, try using a different web browser to see if the issue is browser-specific. This will help you determine if the problem is with Anki or your browser.\n\n4. Adjust Anki's settings: Anki has a setting called \"Use WebKit\" in its preferences. If you're using a browser other than Google Chrome, you might need to set \"Use WebKit\" to \"No\" to match your browser's rendering engine. \n\n5. Reinstall Anki: If none of the above steps work, consider reinstalling Anki. This will ensure that you have a clean installation of the software without any potential issues from previous installations.\n\n6. Seek help from the Anki community: If you're still experiencing issues, consider reaching out to the Anki community forums or other users who might have encountered similar problems. They can provide more specific advice based on your operating system and browser.\n\nRemember to back up your Anki data before making any changes, as reinstalling or adjusting settings might affect your existing data.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
