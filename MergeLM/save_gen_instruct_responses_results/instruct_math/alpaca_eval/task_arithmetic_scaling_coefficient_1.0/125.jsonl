{"instruction": "When was hip hop invented?", "output": "Hip hop as a cultural movement and musical genre has its roots in the Bronx, New York City in the 1970s. The exact date of its invention is not pinpointed, but it is generally attributed to the early years of that decade. \n\nThe key elements of hip hop were first developed by African American and Latino youths, who were looking for a new form of self-expression. These elements included DJing (using turntables and mixers to create music), MCing (rapping or spoken word), breakdancing, and graffiti art.\n\nThe first hip hop song is often considered to be \"Rapper's Delight\" by The Sugarhill Gang, which was released in 1979. However, the genre's evolution and popularity grew throughout the 1980s, with artists like Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, and Public Enemy making significant contributions.\n\nSo, while it's challenging to pinpoint an exact date for the invention of hip hop, it's more accurate to say that it emerged and evolved over a period of time in the 1970s and 1980s in the Bronx, New York City.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
