{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Somali  dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Canjeero?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Canjeero is a popular Somali bread that is similar to a crepe or pancake. It's a staple in Somali cuisine and is often served with various stews and sauces. Here's a simple recipe for Canjeero:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n2. 1 teaspoon of salt\n3. 1 tablespoon of sugar\n4. 1 cup of warm water\n5. 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.\n\n2. Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients, stirring to form a smooth batter. The batter should be thin but not too runny. If it's too thick, add a little more water.\n\n3. Add the baking powder to the batter and mix well. Baking powder is not a common ingredient in traditional Canjeero, but it helps the batter rise and gives the bread a lighter texture.\n\n4. Heat a non-stick skillet or a regular pan over medium heat. If you're using a non-stick skillet, you may need to add a little oil to the pan.\n\n5. Using a ladle, pour a small amount of the batter onto the pan. The size of the ladleful depends on how large you want your Canjeero to be. If you're a beginner, start with a smaller amount.\n\n6. Cook the Canjeero for about 1-2 minutes, until the bottom side is lightly browned. The top side will start to bubble and the edges will start to dry out.\n\n7. Use a spatula to carefully flip the Canjeero over and cook the other side for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, until it's lightly browned.\n\n8. Remove the Canjeero from the pan and repeat the process with the rest of the batter.\n\n9. Serve the Canjeero warm with your favorite Somali stew or sauce.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Canjeero!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
