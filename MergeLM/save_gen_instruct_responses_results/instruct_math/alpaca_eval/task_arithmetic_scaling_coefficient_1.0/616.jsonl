{"instruction": "Verify the correctness of the given statement.\n\n\"For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd.\"", "output": "The statement \"For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd\" is generally true. \n\nProof:\n\nStep 1: Understand the DefinITIONS\nFirst, we need to understand what the statement is asking. It's saying that for any two odd integers j and k, the product of these two (jk) is also an odd number.\n\nStep 2: DEFINE ODD INTEGERS\nBy definition, an odd integer can be represented as a = 2n + 1, where n is any integer. \n\nStep 3: FIND THE PRODUCT OF ODD INTEGERS\nThe statement is asking if the product of two odd integers j and k, denoted as jk, is also an odd integer. \n\nStep 4: CALCULATE THE PRODUCT\nUsing the definition of odd integers, we can represent j and k as a = 2n + 1 and m = 2p + 1 respectively, where n and p are integers. \n\nStep 5: MULTIPLY THE ODD INTEGERS\nThe product of these two odd integers, jk, can then be calculated as (2n + 1)(2p + 1). \n\nStep 6: Simplify the Expression\nThis can be simplified to 4np + 2n + 2p + 1 = 4n + 2p + 3. \n\nStep 7: RECURSION\nIf we add 2 to this result, we get 4n + 2p + 5. This is 2 more than the number of the next smallest integer (4n + 2p + 3), which is a clue that this number is odd.\n\nStep 8: CONCLUSION\nTherefore, when j and k are odd, their product jk is also odd. This confirms the statement \"For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd\" is true.\n\nSo, the rewritten answer is: The statement is generally true. It is true because odd times odd equals to an odd number.
