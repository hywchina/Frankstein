{"instruction": "Write an interesting and detailed backstory for my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder. The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "output": "Your half-elf ranger character's backstory begins in the heart of the Whispering Woods, a dense and enigmatic forest known for its mystical properties and the home of the ancient elven kingdom of Evernight. The kingdom was a place of unparalleled beauty and magic, where the elves lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the very essence of the forest.\n\nYour character, who we'll call Eira, was born to an elven mother and a human father. While this was not uncommon in Evernight, the circumstances of your birth were shrouded in mystery. Your father, a renowned human ranger, had been drawn to the Whispering Woods by a strange compulsion, driven by a deep connection to the forest and its creatures. He fell in love with your elven mother, and they married in a small, intimate ceremony deep within the woods.\n\nHowever, your father's connection to the forest was not just a romantic one. He was a member of a secretive organization known as the Silent Order, a group of rangers dedicated to protecting the forest and its secrets from those who would exploit them. This order was rumored to have ties to the ancient magic that permeated the Whispering Woods, and they were known to be ruthless in their pursuit of their goals.\n\nAs a child, you were raised in the shadow of these secrets. Your mother, fearful for your safety, kept you hidden within the confines of Evernight, where you were trained in the ways of the ranger by your father. You learned to track, to hunt, and to survive in the forest, but you also learned the darker arts of the Silent Order.\n\nHowever, your idyllic childhood was not to last. When you were just a teenager, tragedy struck. Your father was killed in a skirmish with a rival group of rangers, and your mother was consumed by grief. She retreated deeper into the forest, leaving you alone and vulnerable.\n\nWithout the protection of your parents, you were forced to fend for yourself. You turned to the Silent Order for help, hoping to follow in your father's footsteps and find a sense of purpose. However, the order was not as welcoming as you had hoped. They saw you as a potential threat, a half-elf with the blood of both elves and humans in your veins, and they feared that you might betray them to the rival rangers.\n\nSo, they sent you on a mission to prove your loyalty. They tasked you with stealing a powerful artifact from the rival rangers, a relic that could tip the balance of power in the Whispering Woods. You reluctantly agreed, knowing that this was your only chance to earn your place in the Silent Order.\n\nThe theft was a success, but it came at a heavy cost. You were forced to kill several of the rival rangers, and the act weighed heavily on your conscience. You began to question the Silent Order's methods and the price they were asking you to pay for your loyalty.\n\nAs you continued to work with the Silent Order, you began to uncover more about your family's past and the true nature of the Whispering Woods. You discovered that your father had been involved in a dark conspiracy to harness the ancient magic of the forest for their own purposes, and that your mother's grief was not just for your father's death, but for the loss of her own innocence and the knowledge that she had been complicit in the Silent Order's dark deeds.\n\nThis revelation set you on a new path, one where you vowed to use your skills as a ranger to protect the Whispering Woods and its inhabitants from those who would exploit its magic. You continue to walk this path, a half-elf ranger with a dark and mysterious past, driven by a desire to make amends for the sins of your family and to protect the enigmatic forest that has been your home.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
