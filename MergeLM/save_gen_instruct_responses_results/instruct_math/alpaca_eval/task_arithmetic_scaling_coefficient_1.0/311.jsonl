{"instruction": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "output": "The airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is a reference to a famous line from the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch \"The Dead Parrot Sketch.\" In the sketch, a customer attempts to return a dead parrot to a pet shop owner, who insists that the parrot is not dead, but is simply \"pining for the fjords\" or \"just resting.\" The customer then asks, \"What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" to which the owner responds, \"What do you mean? An African or European swallow?\"\n\nIn terms of the actual scientific answer, the airspeed velocity of a swallow in flight can vary depending on the species and the conditions. African swallows, for example, have been found to have a cruising speed of about 24-30 kilometers per hour (15-19 mph), while European swallows can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour (31 mph) during migration. However, these values are for laden swallows, not unladen ones.\n\nIn the context of the Monty Python sketch, the question is a humorous example of a non-sequitur, a question that doesn't logically follow from the previous conversation. The skit is known for its absurd humor and surreal elements, and the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is a running joke throughout the sketch.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
