{"instruction": "Write a simple guide for uploading the bibliography database\n on Overleaf.", "output": "To upload your bibliography database on Overleaf, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new project on Overleaf:\nGo to the Overleaf website (<https://www.overleaf.com/>), sign in to your account, and click on the \"New Project\" button. Choose a project type that suits your needs, such as \"Bibliography\" or \"Database\".\n\n2. Prepare your bibliography database:\nMake sure your bibliography database is in a format that can be easily imported into Overleaf. The most common formats are .bib (BibTeX) and .csv (Comma Separated Values). If your database is in a different format, you might need to convert it to one of these formats.\n\n3. Upload your bibliography database:\nOnce you have created your project, click on the \"Upload\" button in the top-right corner of the Overleaf editor. Select the file containing your bibliography database from your local computer. Overleaf will automatically import the database into your project.\n\n4. Integrate the bibliography database into your project:\nTo use the bibliography database in your project, you will need to use the appropriate commands or tags, depending on the format of your database.\n\n   a. For BibTeX: Use the \\bibliography command to include the bibliography in your project. The syntax is \\bibliography{your_database_name}.\n   \n   b. For BibTeX with Biber: Follow the same process as above, but replace \\bibliography with \\bibliography{your_database_name}.\n   \n   c. For .csv: You might need to use a specific package or language (like LaTeX) to read and display the .csv file. You can use the \\csvreader command to read the .csv file and display its contents.\n\n5. Cite sources in your project:\nTo cite sources from your bibliography database in your project, use the appropriate citation command or tag, depending on the format of your database.\n\n   a. For BibTeX: Use the \\cite{key} command, where \"key\" is the unique identifier of the source in your bibliography database.\n   \n   b. For BibTeX with Biber: Use the \\cite{key} command, similar to BibTeX.\n   \n   c. For .csv: You might need to use a specific package or language (like Python or R) to read and display the .csv file, and then use a citation command or function to cite sources.\n\n6. Preview and share your project:\nOnce you have integrated your bibliography database into your project and cited sources, you can preview your project to ensure everything looks correct. Share your project with others by sending them the link or exporting it as a PDF.\n\nRemember that the specific commands and steps may vary depending on the format of your bibliography database and the language or package you are using in your project. Always refer to the documentation for your specific use case to ensure accurate results.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
