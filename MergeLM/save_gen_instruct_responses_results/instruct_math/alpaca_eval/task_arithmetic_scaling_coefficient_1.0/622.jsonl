{"instruction": "Using a given amount, determine an appropriate tip.\n\n14% tip on $47.50", "output": "To find a 14% tip on $47.50, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal.\nTo do this, divide the percentage by 100. In this case, 14% becomes 14/100 = 0.14 (as a decimal, this is the same as 14/100).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the tip amount.\nTo find the tip amount, multiply the original amount ($47.50) by the decimal value of the percentage (0.14). This can be done by multiplying 47.5 by 0.14, which gives us 6.6.\n\nStep 3: Provide the final answer.\nThe 14% tip on $47.50 is $6.6. \n\nSo, the rewritten answer is: To calculate a 14% tip on $47.50, first convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing 14 by 100, which gives you 0.14. Then, multiply the original amount ($47.50) by the decimal value of 14% (0.14), which results in a tip amount of $6.6. Therefore, the appropriate tip for a $47.50 meal is $6.6.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
