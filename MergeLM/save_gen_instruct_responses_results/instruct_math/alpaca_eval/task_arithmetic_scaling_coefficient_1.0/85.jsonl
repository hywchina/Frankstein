{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Argentinian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Milanesa de peceto?", "output": "Milanesa de pecio is a traditional Argentinian dish that is similar to the Italian dish \"Milanese\" or \"Torta Milanese\". It's a breaded and fried cutlet, typically made with beef, but it can also be made with chicken or veal. Here's a recipe for a classic Milanesa de pecio:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 500g beef cut into 4 servings (you can use round steak, top round, or even chuck)\n2. 2 eggs\n3. 2 cups of bread crumbs\n4. 1 onion, finely chopped\n5. 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n6. 1 teaspoon of salt\n7. 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper\n8. 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin (optional, but it adds a nice Argentinian flavor)\n9. Vegetable oil for frying\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. First, you need to tenderize the meat. In a bowl, combine the meat with the onion, garlic, salt, black pepper, and cumin. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for better flavor.\n\n2. After the meat has marinated, you need to tenderize it further by beating it with a meat mallet or a rolling pin. This will help to break down the fibers and make the meat more tender.\n\n3. Next, beat the eggs in a separate bowl. In another bowl, mix the bread crumbs.\n\n4. Coat the meat: Dip each piece of meat into the egg, making sure it's fully coated. Then, roll the meat in the bread crumbs, pressing the crumbs onto the meat to ensure they stick well.\n\n5. Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the breaded meat pieces and fry them until they're golden brown on both sides. This should take about 3-4 minutes per side.\n\n6. Remove the meat from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n\n7. Serve the Milanesa de pecio with mashed potatoes, boiled or mashed sweet potatoes, or with a simple salad. It's also delicious with a glass of Malbec, a popular Argentinian wine.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Milanesa de pecio!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
