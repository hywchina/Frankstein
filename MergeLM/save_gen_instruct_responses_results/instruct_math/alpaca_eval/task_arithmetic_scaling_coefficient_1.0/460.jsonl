{"instruction": "Can you tell me how to format an url in rst?", "output": "Yes, I can help you with that. In reStructuredText (RST), you can use the `url` role to format an URL. Here's a detailed step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the URL you want to format. Let's assume the URL is \"https://www.example.com/this-is-a-sample-url\".\n\n2. To format this URL in RST, you would use the `url` role. The format for using the `url` role is:\n\n   `[role]: <URL>`.\n\n3. Replace \"role\" with the name of the role you want to use for the link (in this case, \"url\" is a common choice), and `<URL>` with the actual URL you want to link to.\n\n4. So, in your reStructuredText document, you would write:\n\n   `[url]: <https://www.example.com/this-is-a-sample-url>`.\n\n5. The \"> \" at the end is part of the RST markup. It tells the reader that the text following it is a link.\n\n6. If you want to add a title to the link, you can do so by adding the title after the URL, like this: `[url]: <https://www.example.com/this-is-a-sample-url> \"This is a sample title\"].\n\n7. The \"This is a sample title\" part is the title of the link, and it appears as a tooltip when the reader hovers over the link.\n\nSo, the final, more detailed, and clear answer is: To format an URL in reStructuredText, you use the `url` role, which is represented as `[url]: <URL>`. Replace \"URL\" with the actual URL, and if you want to add a title, you can do so by adding \" \"This is a sample title]\" after the URL.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
