{"instruction": "In this math problem, we are asked to figure out the percentage of total profits that are made in each quarter. They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters?", "output": "To find the total profit percentage over a period of time, we need to add up the percentages of profits made in each quarter. This is because each quarter represents a part of the total period, and the percentages are given for each part. \n\nSo, we add the percentages together:\n\n- The first quarter has a 90% profit.\n- The second quarter has a 92% profit.\n- The third quarter has an 81% profit.\n- The fourth quarter has an 88% profit.\n\nWhen we add these percentages together, we get:\n\n90 (from the first quarter) + 92 (from the second quarter) + 81 (from the third quarter) + 88 (from the fourth quarter)\n\nThis gives us a total of 351. \n\nHowever, this is the sum of the individual percentages, not the total profit. The total profit is the percentage of the total period that these four quarters represent. \n\nThe total period (for this scenario) is 100% (since 100 represents a whole whole, and we're considering the quarters as parts of a whole), and we've found that these four quarters represent 90 + 92 + 81 + 88 = 351.\n\nSo, to find the total profit, we need to find the percentage that represents the whole (100%). We do this by dividing the sum of the percentages (351) by the total percentage of the whole (100%). \n\nSo, 351 (the sum of the percentages) divided by 100 (the total percentage of the whole) equals approximately 3.51.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total profit percent over a period of time, which should be a percentage. Therefore, we round this decimal up to the nearest whole number, because it's not possible to have a fraction of a percentage.\n\nSo, the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters, is approximately 3.51, which rounds up to 4%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: 4.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
