{"instruction": "Mick pays his teacher $800 for 40 lessons worth 2 hours each. If this will be all he is going to pay for his lessons, how much did he receive?", "output": "First, we need to find the total hours of lessons Mick received. We know that he paid for 40 lessons, and each lesson has a duration of 2 hours. So, to find the total hours of lessons, we can multiply the number of lessons by the hours per lesson:\n\nTotal hours = (Number of lessons) x (Hours per lesson)\nTotal hours = 40 lessons x 2 hours/lesson = <<40*2=80>>80 hours\n\nNow, we know that Mick received a total of 80 hours of lessons. The teacher charged $800 for these 80 hours. To find the total amount Mick had to pay, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal amount = (Total hours) / (Hours per dollar)\n\nWe need to convert the total hours into dollars for this formula to make sense. We know that 1 hour of lessons costs $80 (80 hours / 2 hours per dollar), so we can use this information to find the total amount Mick had to pay:\n\nHours per dollar = 80 hours / 80 = <<80/80=1>>1 hour/dollar\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the total amount Mick had to pay:\n\nTotal amount = (Total hours) / (Hours per dollar)\nTotal amount = 80 hours = 80 * $1/hour = $<<80*1=80>>80\n\nSo, Mick had to pay a total of $80 for all 40 lessons. The detailed and clear answer is: $80.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
