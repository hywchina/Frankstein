The rules are:\n\n1. The number in each row must be unique.\n2. The number in each column must also be unique.\n3. The number in each 3x3 square (including the top-left corner, middle, and bottom-right corner) must also be unique.\n\nLet's start:\n\nStep 1: We look at the top-left corner of the grid, which is a 1. We need to find a number that hasn't been used yet in the first row, second column. We see that 2 is the first unused number, so we write it in. Now our puzzle looks like this:\n\n|1| 2|  |  |  |  |8|  |\n|  | 6|  |  |  |3|  |4|\n|8|3|4|6|7|  |9|  |  |\n|2|9|1|  |  |8|3|7|6|\n|  |  |6|  |  |9|8|1|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |2|  |  |  |\n|  |2|  |  |9|7|6|  |  |\n|5|4|  |  |  |  |  |9|8|\n|6|1|  |  |  |5|4|3|7|\n\nStep 2: Next, we look at the second row, second column, which is a 4. We need to find a number that hasn't been used yet in the second row. We see that the number 5 hasn't been used yet, so we write it in. Our puzzle now looks like this:\n\n|1| 2| 5|  |  |  |8|  |\n|  | 6| 4|  |  |3|  |4|\n|8|3|4|6|7|  |9|  |  |\n|2|9|1|  |  |8|3|7|6|\n|  |  |6|  |  |9|8|1|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |2|  |  |  |\n|  |2|  |  |9|7|6|  |  |\n|5|4|  |  |  |  |  |9|8|\n|6|1|  |  |  |5|4|3|7|\n\nStep 3: We continue this process, filling in the numbers based on the rules of Sudoku. After a few more steps, we find that the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n|1| 2| 5| 8| 7| 4| 6|\n|  | 6| 4| 3| 9| 2| 1|\n|8|3|4|6|7| 9| 7| 8|\n|2|9|1| 2| 1| 3| 9| 6|\n|  |  |6| 3| 9| 4| 1| 5|\n|  |  |  | 2| 1| 2| 3| 7|\n|  |2| 1| 9| 6| 1| 6| 4|\n|5|4| 8| 5| 3| 1| 9| 7|\n|6|1| 7| 9| 4| 2| 3| 1|\n\nSo, the final answer is: 7.\n\nThe answer is: 7.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
