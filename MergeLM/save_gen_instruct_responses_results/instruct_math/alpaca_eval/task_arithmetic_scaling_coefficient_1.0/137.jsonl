{"instruction": "I'm currently studying Bioengineering in Argentina, focusing on computational neuroscience. I'll be graduating in May, and planning to apply to PhD programs in the US at the end of the year in order to start August 2024. I'm thinking of what to do/study during this year until my program starts. Could you give me ideas? Feel free to ask me for questions which would help you give me better suggestions.", "output": "Congratulations on your upcoming graduation and your decision to pursue a PhD in the US! Here are some ideas for things you can do or study during the year leading up to the start of your program in August 2024:\n\n1. Research experience: Try to gain more research experience in computational neuroscience. This could involve working in a lab, participating in research projects, or even conducting independent research. This will not only strengthen your CV but also give you a deeper understanding of the field.\n\n2. Online courses and certifications: Enroll in online courses or certification programs related to computational neuroscience, biotechnology, or other relevant fields. This will help you stay updated with the latest advancements in your field and demonstrate your commitment to continuous learning.\n\n3. Teaching or tutoring: Consider teaching or tutoring students in subjects related to bioengineering or computational neuroscience. This will help you develop your communication skills and gain a deeper understanding of the material.\n\n4. Attend workshops and conferences: Participate in workshops, seminars, and conferences related to computational neuroscience. This will give you an opportunity to network with professionals in the field, learn about the latest research, and present your own work if possible.\n\n5. Networking: Establish connections with professionals in the field. Attend networking events, join professional organizations, and connect with researchers and professors on LinkedIn. Strong connections can lead to valuable recommendations and future research opportunities.\n\n6. Improve your English (if needed): If English is not your first language, consider taking an English proficiency exam and improving your language skills. Strong English skills will be beneficial for your PhD program and future career.\n\n7. Prepare for the GRE and TOEFL (if needed): If required by the PhD programs you're applying to, prepare for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Many preparation materials are available online, and taking practice tests can help you improve your scores.\n\n8. Write and publish a research paper: If you have a research project or a literature review, consider writing a paper and submitting it to a scientific journal. This will demonstrate your ability to conduct research and communicate your findings.\n\n9. Volunteer or intern: Gain experience in related fields, such as biotechnology, neuroscience, or related medical fields. This can be a great way to explore different aspects of the field and build your resume.\n\n10. Learn a new skill: Acquire a new skill or software that is relevant to computational neuroscience, such as programming languages (e.g., Python, MATLAB), data analysis tools, or software for modeling and simulation.\n\nPlease provide any additional information or specific questions you have, and I'll be happy to help you with more tailored suggestions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
