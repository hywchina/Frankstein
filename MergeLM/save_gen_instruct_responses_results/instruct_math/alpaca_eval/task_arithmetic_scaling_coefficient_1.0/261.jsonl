{"instruction": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I\u2019m a five year old", "output": "Sarcoidosis is a disease that affects some people's bodies. It's a bit like when you have a cold, but instead of just making you feel sick, it can affect different parts of the body like your skin, eyes, and even your lungs.\n\nThe disease causes tiny clumps of cells, called granulomas, to form in these different parts of the body. These granulomas can make the areas around them red, swollen, and sometimes they can cause scarring.\n\nThe good news is that sarcoidosis usually doesn't make people very sick, and it can even go away on its own without any treatment. But sometimes, it can make people feel tired or give them a cough, especially if the granulomas are in the lungs.\n\nIf the doctors think that the sarcoidosis is making you very sick or if it's not going away, they might suggest some medicine to help make you feel better. But for most people with sarcoidosis, they just need to keep an eye on it and take rest when they need it.\n\nSo, sarcoidosis is a condition where the body forms clumps of cells called granulomas in different parts of the body, which can cause redness, swelling, and scarring. It can make people feel tired or give them a cough, but it usually doesn't make people very sick and can go away on its own.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
