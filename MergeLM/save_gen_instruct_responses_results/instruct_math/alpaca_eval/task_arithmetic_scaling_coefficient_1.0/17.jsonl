{"instruction": "Hi, I'm interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me?", "output": "Of course! Badminton is a fun and fast-paced racquet sport that is played on a rectangular court with two players (or two teams of two) hitting a shuttlecock (a small, projectile object with feathers or a plastic body) back and forth over a net. The objective is to hit the shuttlecock in such a way that your opponent is unable to return it within the boundaries of the court or to force them to make a mistake, thus scoring points.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the game:\n\n1. Court and Equipment: The game is played on a rectangular court, 44 feet long and 20 feet wide for professional matches. The court is divided into two halves by a net that stands at 5 feet 1 inch high in the middle. Players use a racquet (or badminton racquet) to hit the shuttlecock.\n\n2. Scoring: A standard game of badminton is the best two out of three games, with each game being played to 21 points. So, the total match duration is usually around 1 hour. If the score is tied at 20-20, the game goes into a \"deuce\" state, and the first player to win two consecutive points is the winner.\n\n3. Serving: The game starts with a serve. The server stands behind the right service line and must serve the shuttlecock diagonally to the opponent's court. The shuttlecock must clear the net and land in the opponent's court. The receiver then returns the shuttlecock.\n\n4. Playing: Players take turns hitting the shuttlecock, with the aim of making it land on the opponent's side of the court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it within the allowed time or make them commit a fault. Players can hit the shuttlecock in the air (known as a \"jump smash\") for a powerful, high-speed hit, or they can hit it on the ground for a lower, more controlled shot.\n\n5. Points and Faults: A point is scored when the opponent is unable to return the shuttlecock or makes a mistake. If the shuttlecock hits the ground or goes out of bounds, if the player makes a fault (like hitting the shuttlecock twice in a row or hitting it with an open racket), or if the shuttlecock hits the net but lands in the opponent's court, the rally is over, and the point goes to the other player.\n\nRemember, badminton is a fast-paced game that requires agility, speed, and good hand-eye coordination. It's a great sport for improving fitness and having fun with friends or as a competitive activity.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
