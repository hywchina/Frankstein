{"instruction": "Write me a poem in the style of neruda", "output": "In the style of Pablo Neruda, a poet of passion and fire,\nI pen this ode to the one who inspires my heart's desire.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, under the moon's soft glow,\nI write these lines for you, my love, as the stars up above bestow\n\nYour eyes, like the ocean's depths, hold secrets untold,\nYet in their depths, I see a world both brave and bold.\n\nYour lips, a rose's petals, soft and inviting,\nIn their touch, I find solace, a love that's exciting.\n\nYour voice, a melody that echoes through my days,\nIn its song, I find comfort, a love that chases all my fears away.\n\nYour laughter, a symphony that fills my soul with light,\nIn its echo, I find joy, a love that makes my heart take flight.\n\nYour touch, a flame that ignites a fire within my heart,\nIn its warmth, I find solace, a love that sets me apart.\n\nSo here's my poem, a tribute to your beauty and grace,\nIn the style of Neruda, I sing your praises, my love, in this place.\n\nFor you, my darling, are the sun that lights my sky,\nThe moon that guides my nights, the stars that catch my eye.\n\nYou are the love that fills my heart, the passion in my veins,\nThe poetry that flows from my pen, the song that fills the plains.\n\nAnd as I close this verse, I pray that you will see,\nThe love I hold for you, the love that's meant to be.\n\nFor in your arms, I find my home, my peace, my rest,\nIn your love, I am the best, the greatest that I can be.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
