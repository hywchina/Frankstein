{"instruction": "What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame? Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?", "output": "To determine the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p30fps on Twitch while playing an online videogame, we first need to calculate the bitrate required for 720p30fps. \n\n1. First, convert the frame rate to Hz: 30fps * (1 Hz/fps) = <<30*1=30>>30 Hz\n2. Next, calculate the bitrate for a single channel of 720p30: 60 MBit/s (since 720 * 30 = <<720*30=21600>>21600)\n3. Since the video is in YUV format, we need to multiply the bitrate by 2 (one for Y and one for U and V) -> 2 * 21600 MBit/s = <<2*21600=43200>>43200 MBit/s\n4. Convert the bitrate to kbps: 43200 MBit/s * (1000 kbps / 1 MBit/s) = <<43200*1000=43200000>>43200000 kbps\n\nAccording to Twitch's recommendation, they suggest an upload speed of 3000 kbps for 720p30fps. The calculation we just did (43200000 kbps) is the minimum bitrate required for the video itself, not considering the gameplay.\n\nFor a smooth gaming experience, you would typically need an upload speed that's at least twice the recommended video bitrate to account for the additional data from the game, such as player movements, voice, and other in-game actions. \n\nSo, the minimum upload speed for a smooth Twitch stream and online gameplay would be:\n\n43200000 kbps (minimum bitrate for 720p30fps) * (2 * 1) = <<43200000*2=86400000>>86400000 kbps\n\nHowever, if we consider Twitch's recommended upload speed as a safe margin, you should aim for an upload speed of 3000 kbps + a little extra for the game data. The exact extra headroom needed would depend on the specific game and its data requirements, which isn't provided. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, you should aim for an upload speed of at least 3000 kbps + 86400000 kbps (the minimum bitrate for 720p30fps) for a smooth Twitch stream and online gameplay. However, the exact extra headroom needed for the game data cannot be determined without more information about the game's data requirements.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
