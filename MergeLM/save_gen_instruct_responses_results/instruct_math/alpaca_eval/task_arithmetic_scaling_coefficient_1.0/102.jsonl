{"instruction": "Whats the largest star in our galaxy?", "output": "The largest star in our galaxy is called VY Canis Majoris, also known as VY CMa for short. It's located in the constellation Canis Major, which is visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere. \n\nTo give you an idea of its size, VY CMa is about 2,100 times larger than our own sun. It's a red hypergiant, a type of star that's extremely large and luminous. \n\nThe diameter of VY CMa is estimated to be around 2.8 billion kilometers (1.7 billion miles), which is more than twice the diameter of our sun. To put that in perspective, if VY CMa were at the center of our solar system, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Saturn.\n\nDespite its immense size, VY CMa is also extremely distant from Earth. It's about 5,000 times more distant from us than our sun is, which means it's very difficult to observe in detail. \n\nSo, to summarize, the largest star in our galaxy, VY Canis Majoris, is a red hypergiant with a diameter of about 2.8 billion kilometers (1.7 billion miles), making it significantly larger than our sun.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
