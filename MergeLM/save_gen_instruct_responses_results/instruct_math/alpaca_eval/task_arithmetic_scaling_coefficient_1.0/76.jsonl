Vitel ton\u00e9 is a traditional Uruguayan dish that is similar to a French dish called Steak au Poivre, but with a Uruguayan twist. It's a peppercorn steak that is typically served with a side of mashed potatoes or boiled potatoes. Here's a simple recipe for Vitel ton\u00e9:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 kg beef sirloin steak (about 2-3 cm thick)\n2. Salt and black pepper, to taste\n3. 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil\n4. 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n5. 1 tablespoon of tomato paste\n6. 1 cup of white wine (dry)\n7. 50 ml of cognac (optional, but it adds a nice flavor)\n8. 100 ml of beef broth\n9. 2 tablespoons of butter\n10. Fresh parsley, for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. First, preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n\n2. Season the steak: Rub the steak with salt and black pepper on both sides.\n\n3. Heat the oil in an oven-safe pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for a minute until fragrant.\n\n4. Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.\n\n5. Add the wine and cognac (if using) to the pan, stirring to deglaze the pan and remove any stuck bits.\n\n6. Add the beef broth to the pan and bring it to a boil.\n\n7. Place the steak in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. You can check this by using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should be at least 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) for medium-rare.\n\n8. While the steak is cooking, heat the butter in the same pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the parsley and cook for a minute until fragrant.\n\n9.
