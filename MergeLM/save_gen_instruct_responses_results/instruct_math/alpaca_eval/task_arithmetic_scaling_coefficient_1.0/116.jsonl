{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to make my own peanut brittle. Can you give me a recipe and cooking instructions for that?", "output": "Absolutely! Here's a classic peanut brittle recipe that yields a deliciously crunchy and sweet treat. \n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 cup (200g) unsalted butter\n2. 1 cup (200g) granulated white sugar\n3. 1 cup (100g) peanuts\n4. 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n5. 1 teaspoon baking soda\n6. 1 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\n\nStep 1: Preheat your oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. \n\nStep 2: In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, and pure vanilla extract. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture reaches a temperature of 240\u00b0F (116\u00b0C) on a candy thermometer. This is known as the soft-ball stage of candy making.\n\nStep 3: While the sugar syrup is cooking, mix the baking soda and salt in a small bowl. These are the ingredients that will give your peanut brittle its characteristic crunch.\n\nStep 4: Once the sugar syrup has reached the correct temperature, remove it from the heat and quickly add the baking soda and salt mixture. Stir this mixture well to ensure the baking soda and salt are evenly distributed.\n\nStep 5: Add the peanuts to the hot sugar syrup mixture. The heat will cause the peanuts to roast as they're coated in the syrup, giving the peanut brittle a delicious nutty flavor.\n\nStep 6: Spread the peanut-sugar mixture evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. This will form the base of your peanut brittle.\n\nStep 7: Allow the mixture to cool for about 30 minutes, or until it has thickened slightly and become more manageable. This is a crucial step as it allows the brittle to set and become less sticky.\n\nStep 8: Once the mixture has cooled enough, use a sharp knife or a metal spatula to cut it into traditional peanut brittle shapes. You can cut it into strips, squares, or even use a cookie cutter for fun shapes.\n\nStep 9: Leave the peanut brittle on the baking sheet to cool completely. This will take another 30-60 minutes, depending on the humidity in your kitchen.\n\nStep 10: Once the peanut brittle is completely cool and hard, it's ready to eat! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to keep it fresh.\n\nEnjoy your homemade peanut brittle!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
