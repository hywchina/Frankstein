{"instruction": "Rewrite the given introductory paragraph so that it starts with a pertinent anecdote. Also rewrite the thesis so that it is succinct and concise:    \"Many types of black people have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\u201d This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\"", "output": "Anecdotal Introduction:\nOnce, I had a conversation with an African American friend who shared a story about visiting Africa for the first time. He was amazed by the similarities in language, music, and dance between the African people he met and African Americans in the United States. This made him realize that despite the Atlantic Ocean separating them, they shared a common cultural heritage. This anecdote sparked my interest in exploring the differences and similarities between African and African American cultures.\n\nRewritten Thesis:\nAfrican and African American cultures, both considered Black, have a shared ancestry yet distinct identities. Their experiences, records, and practices vary. By examining these differences and similarities, we can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of cultural exploration, as Saint Augustine's quote reminds us, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\" My goal is to delve into the unique aspects of each culture and the lessons they can offer to each other.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
