{"instruction": "What are some species of bears that are now extinct?", "output": "There are several species of bears that are now extinct. Some of these include:\n\n1. Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus): This bear lived in Europe during the Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 25,000 years ago. It was larger than the modern brown bear and had a more robust build.\n\n2. Short-faced Bear (Arctodus simus): This bear lived in North America during the Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 10,000 years ago. It was the largest bear that ever lived in North America, weighing up to 1,500 pounds.\n\n3. Giant Short-faced Bear (Arctodus gigas): This bear lived in South America during the Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 10,000 years ago. It was similar in size to the Short-faced Bear and was likely a top predator in its ecosystem.\n\n4. Sloth Bear (Megarctos savagei): This bear lived in South America during the Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 10,000 years ago. It was a large bear that likely preyed on the now-extinct ground sloths.\n\n5. Tremarctos floridanus: This bear lived in Florida during the late Pleistocene epoch and went extinct around 10,000 years ago. It was smaller than the modern black bear and had a distinctive skull shape.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many bear species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth's history. The exact reasons for their extinction can vary, but factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and competition with other predators have all likely played a role.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
