{"instruction": "Where does pornography come from?", "output": "Pornography, or sexually explicit content created for the purpose of arousing viewers, has a long and complex history that spans across various forms of media and cultures. Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. Ancient Civilizations: The earliest known forms of pornography can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece, Rome, and Egypt. These societies created explicit images and sculptures, often depicting sexual acts and mythological scenes.\n\n2. Print Media: With the invention of printing, pornography began to be produced in written form. In the 15th and 16th centuries, erotic literature and illustrated books became popular in Europe. These works were often private and not openly sold due to their explicit nature.\n\n3. Photography and Film: The invention of photography and motion pictures in the 19th and 20th centuries revolutionized the pornography industry. The first pornographic films were made in the late 1800s, and by the 20th century, these films became more accessible with the advent of cinema.\n\n4. Digital Age: The widespread use of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s led to a significant increase in the production and distribution of pornography. Today, pornography is a multi-billion-dollar industry, with a vast array of content available online, from traditional videos to virtual reality experiences.\n\n5. Modern Forms: In recent years, new forms of pornography have emerged, such as live cam performances, interactive content, and user-generated material. These forms allow for a more personalized and interactive experience for consumers.\n\nIt's important to note that while pornography can be a part of many people's sexual experiences and exploration, it's also a subject of controversy and debate. Issues such as consent, representation, and the potential impact on mental health and relationships are ongoing topics of discussion.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
