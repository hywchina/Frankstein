{"instruction": "Give me some impression of what the world was like in 1950. What were the current-day inventions back then?", "output": "In 1950, the world was a vastly different place compared to today. It was a post-war era, with the Second World War ending just a few years prior in 1945. The world was beginning to rebuild and recover, and technology was starting to play a more significant role in everyday life. Here are some of the current-day inventions that existed in 1950:\n\n1. Television: Television was already a common household item in many parts of the world by 1950. The first commercial television broadcasts began in the late 1940s, and by the 1950s, TV sets were becoming more affordable and widely available.\n\n2. Nuclear Power: The first commercial nuclear power plant, Calder Hall, opened in the United Kingdom in 1956, but the concept of nuclear power was already known and being researched in 1950.\n\n3. Computers: The first commercial computers were developed in the 1950s. The UNIVAC 1, the first commercially produced computer, was released in 1951. These early computers were enormous and expensive, but they laid the foundation for the personal computers that would come later.\n\n4. Credit Cards: The first credit card, the Diners Club card, was introduced in 1950. This was the first step towards the widespread use of credit and debit cards that we have today.\n\n5. Polio Vaccine: In 1952, Dr. Jonas Salk developed the first inactivated polio vaccine, which was a significant step towards the eventual eradication of polio.\n\n6. Microwave Oven: The first microwave oven was invented in 1947, but it wasn't until the 1950s that they became more common in homes. They were initially marketed as a way to reheat leftovers quickly.\n\n7. Antibiotics: The use of antibiotics was still relatively new in 1950, but they were already revolutionizing the field of medicine. Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was discovered in 1928, and by the 1950s, new antibiotics were being discovered and developed.\n\n8. Jet Aircraft: The first commercial jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, entered service in 1952. This marked the beginning of the jet age in air travel.\n\n9. Satellite Technology: The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, but the concept of satellite technology was already being researched and developed in 1950.\n\n10. Antacids: The first antacid, Tums, was introduced in 1950. This marked the beginning of a new approach to heartburn and indigestion relief.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the inventions that were around in 1950. The world was indeed a different place, with many technologies that we now take for granted not yet invented or widely available.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
