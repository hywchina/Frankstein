{"instruction": "Hi open assistant, can you tell me what presidents day is?", "output": "Yes, I'd be happy to explain what Presidents' Day is.\n\nPresidents' Day is a federal holiday in the United States that is celebrated on the third Monday of February. It is also known as Washington's Birthday, as it traditionally honors the birthday of the first U.S. President, George Washington, who was born on February 22.\n\nHowever, since 1971, when the U.S. Congress extended the federal holiday schedule to include all federal employees, Presidents' Day has been observed on the third Monday in February. This change was made to create more three-day weekends for federal employees and to honor all U.S. presidents, not just Washington.\n\nToday, while the name \"Washington's Birthday\" remains in the federal holiday law, in practice, Presidents' Day has become an occasion to celebrate all past presidents of the United States. It is a day for Americans to reflect on the leadership and contributions of their country's presidents, both past and present.\n\nIn terms of celebrations, they can vary widely. Some people might choose to visit historic sites related to the presidency, attend parades, or engage in other patriotic activities. Others might simply take the day off work or school and spend time with family and friends.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
