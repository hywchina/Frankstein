{"instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to play kickball! Kickball is a fun and easy-to-learn team sport that is a combination of baseball and soccer. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the game is played:\n\n1. **Number of Players**: Kickball is typically played with 11 players on each team (10 starters and 1 designated player who is not allowed to kick the ball). However, you can adjust the number of players based on the number of people available.\n\n2. **Divide into Teams**: The players are divided into two teams, with each team having 11 players.\n\n3. **Gameplay**: The game starts with one team playing defense (standing behind a line, usually a baseline in a field) and the other team playing offense (standing in front of the line). The offensive team has one player at a time kick the ball towards the defensive team.\n\n4. **Kicking the Ball**: The player from the offensive team who is up to kick the ball can either kick it like a soccer ball (with the inside or the side of the foot) or a baseball (with a run-up and a kick like a baseball pitch). The goal is to get the ball past the defensive team and into the field.\n\n5. **Running the Bases**: If the kicked ball successfully passes the defensive team's baseline (usually a line marked on the field), the offensive team members not involved in the kick (called \"runners\") can start running towards the defensive team's goal. The runners must touch the ball with their foot after it has been kicked before they can run.\n\n6. **Defending the Goal**: The defensive team tries to stop the offensive team by catching the ball or tagging the runners with the ball before they touch the goal. If a runner is tagged with the ball or the ball is caught, the runner is out.\n\n7. **Scoring**: If the offensive team successfully gets the ball into the goal of the defensive team without any runners being tagged out, they score a point. The teams switch roles for the next inning.\n\n8. **Game Length**: The game usually lasts for a certain number of innings (like baseball), and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and play fairly. Don't be afraid to ask questions or clarify the rules if you're unsure. Your sister and her friends will likely be more than happy to help you understand the game better. Good luck and enjoy playing kickball!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
