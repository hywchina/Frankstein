{"instruction": "A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. <br>He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over?", "output": "First, we need to determine the monthly decrease in the value of the new car. The value decreases by 1.5 percent per month, but this percentage increases to 0.5 percent after a certain number of months. Let's calculate the monthly decrease amount:\n\n1. Calculate the annual decrease for the first part of the calculation (0-0.5 * 100): 1.5 - 0.5 = <<1.5-0.5=1>>1 percent per month.\n2. Calculate the annual decrease for the second part of the calculation (0.5 * 100): 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 percent per month.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net decrease in the value of the new car each month, considering both parts.\n\n1. Calculate the net monthly decrease: 1 percent (first part) + (-0.5 percent, second part) = 0.5 percent per month.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many months it will take for the decrease in the value of his old car to equal the difference between the value of the new car and the amount he needs to save ($8000 - $2000 = $<<8000-2000=6000>>6000).\n\n1. Calculate the number of months for the old car's value to decrease to $0: 6000 / 0.5 = <<6000/0.5=12000>>12 months.\n\nThe man starts with $0 savings, so he needs 12 months to save up enough money to buy the new car.\n\n1. Calculate the total amount saved in 12 months: 12 * $1000 = $<<12*1000=12000>>12000.\n\nFinally, let's find out how much money he will have left over after buying the new car.\n\n1. Calculate the remaining amount: $12000 (total savings) - $8000 (cost of the new car) - $2000 (value of his old car) = $<<12000-8000-2000=2000>>2000.\n\nSo, it will take him 12 months to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and he will have $2000 left over.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
