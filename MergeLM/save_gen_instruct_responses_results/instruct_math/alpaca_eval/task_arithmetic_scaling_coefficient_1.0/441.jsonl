{"instruction": "what does the @ in python do", "output": "In Python, the \"@\" symbol is used to create a decorator function or method. A decorator is a special type of function that can modify the behavior of another function or class. It is defined by appending the \"@\" symbol to the beginning of a function or method name. The purpose of a decorator is to add extra functionality or modify the existing functionality of a function or method without changing its source code.\n\nHere's a simple example of a decorator function:\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator():\n    def decorator(func):\n        print(\"Calling the function...\")\n        return func\n    return decorator\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nsay_hello()  # This will print \"Calling the function...\" before printing \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator function that simply prints \"Calling the function...\" before calling the original function. The `say_hello` function is decorated with `my_decorator`, so when `say_hello` is called, it first calls `my_decorator`, which in turn calls the original `say_hello` function.\n\nDecorators are a powerful feature in Python and are commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as implementing logging, caching, or adding authentication checks to functions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
