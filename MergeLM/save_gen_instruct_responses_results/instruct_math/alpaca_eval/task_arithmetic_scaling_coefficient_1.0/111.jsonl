{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Bolivian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Chola Sandwich?", "output": "The Chola Sandwich is a popular street food in Bolivia, particularly in the capital city of La Paz. It's a simple yet flavorful sandwich that is typically made with a few basic ingredients. Here's a recipe for a Chola Sandwich:\n\nIngredients:\n1. Bread (preferably a crusty roll or a bolillo, which is a type of Mexican bread)\n2. Llapingachos (a type of potato patty)\n3. Chicharr\u00f3n (fried pork rinds)\n4. Aj\u00ed (a spicy Bolivian sauce, similar to hot sauce)\n5. Chopped cilantro for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Start by preparing the llapingachos. To do this, boil or bake potatoes until they are soft. Mash them and mix in some salt, cumin, and a little bit of flour. Form the mixture into small patties.\n\n2. Next, heat some oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the llapingachos to the pan and cook them until they are golden brown on both sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes.\n\n3. While the llapingachos are cooking, heat the chicharr\u00f3n in a separate pan. Chicharr\u00f3n is fried pork rinds, which you can find in most Latin American markets.\n\n4. Now, to assemble the Chola Sandwich, take a piece of bread and spread a generous amount of aj\u00ed on it. Aj\u00ed is a spicy Bolivian sauce, so be careful not to put too much if you don't like it too hot.\n\n5. Add a few pieces of the cooked llapingachos on top of the aj\u00ed. Then, add some of the fried chicharr\u00f3n on top of the llapingachos.\n\n6. Finally, top everything off with another piece of bread to make a sandwich.\n\n7. Garnish the sandwich with some chopped cilantro and serve.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Chola Sandwich! This is just one of many Bolivian dishes you can try. Bolivian cuisine has a lot of variety, from hearty stews to fresh salads, so feel free to experiment and find more recipes to add to your repertoire.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
