{"instruction": "Are there any free SAST tools out there?", "output": "Yes, there are several free SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools available. These tools help identify potential security vulnerabilities in the source code of an application. Here are some popular free SAST tools:\n\n1. Open Source Security Testing Tools (OSST):\nOSST is a suite of tools that includes SAST tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, OWASP CodeCrawler, and OWASP Antlr, which can be used to analyze Java, .NET, and other applications for security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. SonarQube:\nSonarQube is a popular open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It includes a SAST component that can identify security vulnerabilities in several programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, and .NET.\n\n3. FindBugs:\nFindBugs is a Java-specific SAST tool that can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in Java applications. It works by analyzing the bytecode of the application and can be integrated into the development process to provide real-time feedback.\n\n4. OWASP DefectDojo:\nOWASP DefectDojo is an open-source tool that allows developers to perform security testing on their applications. It supports multiple programming languages and can be used for both manual and automated testing.\n\n5. Veracode's Community Edition:\nVeracode offers a free Community Edition of their platform, which includes SAST capabilities. This edition allows developers to upload and analyze small applications for security vulnerabilities.\n\nPlease note that while these tools are free, they may have limitations in terms of the number of lines of code they can analyze or the types of vulnerabilities they can detect. For more comprehensive and large-scale applications, you may need to consider paid SAST tools or a combination of free and paid tools.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
