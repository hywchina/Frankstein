{"instruction": "Write a snoopdogg rap explaining how to not commit a warcrime", "output": "(Verse 1)\nYo, it's Snoop Dogg in the house, and I'm here to drop some knowledge\nAbout the rules of war and how to be a soldier, not a villain, you feel me?\nFirst, you gotta understand the Geneva Conventions\nThey're the guidelines for war, and they're non-negotiable, no exceptions\n\n(Chorus)\nDon't commit a war crime, don't be a fool\nRespect the rules of war, that's the golden rule\nProtect the innocent, and always be just\nThat's how you represent the D-O-G-G in the dust\n\n(Verse 2)\nNow, let's break it down:\n\n1. Rule Number One: Don't attack civilians, man\nThey're not in the fight, they're just trying to live their lives\nHospitals, schools, and cultural sites are off-limits, you dig?\nLeave 'em alone, or you'll face the consequences, and it ain't gonna be pretty\n\n2. Rule Number Two: Treat prisoners of war with respect\nThey're human beings, too, and they deserve to be treated right\nNo torture, no abuse, no inhumane treatment, you hear me?\nIf you capture an enemy, show 'em compassion, like you would want for your G\n\n3. Rule Number Three: Follow the chain of command\nMake sure your actions are authorized by your superiors, or you'll be in the wrong\nIf you're unsure about an order, question it, but don't just do it without a second thought\n\n(Chorus)\nDon't commit a war crime, don't be a fool\nRespect the rules of war, that's the golden rule\nProtect the innocent, and always be just\nThat's how you represent the D-O-G-G in the dust\n\n(Outro)\nSo, to all the soldiers out there, remember my words\nYou represent your country, your unit, and the code of the warrior\nFollow these rules, and you'll be a hero, not a villain\nAnd that's the rap, the truth, and the message from Snoop Dogg.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
