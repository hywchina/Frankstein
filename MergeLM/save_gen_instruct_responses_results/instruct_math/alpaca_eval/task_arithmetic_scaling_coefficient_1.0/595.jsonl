It could be an auto-generated number or a customer's account number, whichever is more suitable for your business.\n\n2. **Subscriber Information**: This includes the name, email address, phone number, and address of the person or entity that is subscribing to the service. This information helps in communication and billing purposes.\n\n3. **Subscription Plan**: This column stores the details of the subscription plan that the subscriber has chosen. This could include the plan name, its description, the billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually), and the price or cost associated with it.\n\n4. **Start Date**: This is the date when the subscription starts. This information is crucial for billing and accounting purposes.\n\n5. **End Date**: This is the date when the subscription ends. If the subscription is indefinite, this field can be left empty or marked as \"ongoing\".\n\n6. **Status**: This column indicates the current status of the subscription. This could be \"active\", \"inactive\", \"expired\", \"cancelled\", or \"pending\". This information helps in managing the subscriber base and billing.\n\n7. **Payment Method**: This is the method by which the subscriber pays for the subscription. This could be a credit card, debit card, PayPal, bank transfer, or any other preferred payment method.\n\n8. **Billing History**: This is a record of all billing transactions related to the subscription. This includes the amount billed, the date of the transaction, and the status of the payment.\n\n9. **Notes**: This is a free-form text field where you can add any additional information about the subscription that might be relevant. This could include special requests, customer feedback, or any other notes.\n\nThis template table provides a comprehensive framework for managing all aspects of a subscription. Depending on your specific business needs, you might need to add or remove columns, or modify the data types to suit your requirements.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
