{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?", "output": "Of course! Racquetball is a fun and fast-paced sport that is played in a court with four walls. The game is played with two players (singles) or four players (doubles), using racquets to hit a ball against the front wall of the court. The objective is to make the ball bounce less than or equal to one time on the ground, and then hit it in such a way that it passes over the net and touches the front wall before the opponent can return it.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the game:\n\n1. Court Setup: The racquetball court is 40 feet long, 20 feet wide, and has a height of 20 feet. The front wall, where the ball must hit first, is made of a material that allows the ball to bounce, while the side and back walls are made of a non-bouncing material.\n\n2. Serving: The game starts with a serve. The server stands behind the service line and hits the ball in such a way that it bounces on the front wall. The ball must clear the short line, a line 12 feet from the back wall, in order to be considered a valid serve.\n\n3. Playing the Ball: The player who receives the serve (the \"receiver\") must return the ball so that it hits the front wall and then bounces on the floor. The player who hit the serve (the \"server\") must then return the ball before it bounces twice on the receiver's side.\n\n4. Scoring: A point is scored by the player who makes the ball bounce less than or equal to one time on their opponent's side. If the ball bounces more than once, or if it hits the floor outside the playing area, the point goes to the other player. A match is typically played to 15 or 21 points, with the winner being the first to reach the agreed-upon score.\n\n5. Doubles: In doubles, the rules are the same, but with four players. The server and receiver roles alternate between teams.\n\nRemember, racquetball is a physically demanding sport that requires good hand-eye coordination, agility, and stamina. It's a great way to stay fit and have fun with friends or other players. As you learn the game, you'll find that it's not just about hitting the ball, but also about strategy, positioning, and outsmarting your opponent.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
