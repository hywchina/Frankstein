{"instruction": "Help me get a job in the government in which I\u2019ll have major bargaining power", "output": "To get a job in the government with major bargaining power, you should aim for positions that involve policy-making, regulation, or management. These roles typically require specific qualifications and experience. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this goal:\n\n1. Identify the sector and level of government: Determine the specific sector of the government you're interested in (e.g., federal, state, or local) and the level of government (e.g., executive, legislative, or judicial).\n\n2. Obtain the necessary education and experience: Many government positions, especially those with bargaining power, require advanced degrees and relevant experience. For example, a law degree (J.D.) or a Master's in Public Administration (MPA) can be beneficial. Gain experience in the field through internships, volunteering, or entry-level positions.\n\n3. Build a strong network: Networking is crucial in the government sector. Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with professionals in your desired field. This can help you learn about job openings and gain insights into the application process.\n\n4. Develop relevant skills: Acquire skills that are valuable in the government sector, such as policy analysis, negotiation, public speaking, and project management. You can enhance these skills through coursework, workshops, or professional development programs.\n\n5. Apply for job openings: Regularly check government job websites, such as USAJobs for federal positions, and state-specific job boards for opportunities in your desired sector. Tailor your resume and cover letter to each job application, highlighting your relevant education, experience, and skills.\n\n6. Prepare for the application process: Many government positions require a rigorous application process, which may include exams, interviews, and background checks. Prepare for these by practicing with sample questions, understanding the selection process, and ensuring your application materials are error-free.\n\n7. Consider starting at a lower level: It's essential to be patient and willing to start at a lower level if you're new to the field. You can work your way up to positions with more bargaining power by demonstrating your competence, dedication, and commitment to public service.\n\n8. Stay informed about policy and politics: Keep up-to-date with the latest news, trends, and policy changes in your sector. This will help you understand the context of the positions you're applying for and make you a more competitive candidate.\n\nBy following these steps and remaining persistent, you can increase your chances of securing a government job with major bargaining power.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
