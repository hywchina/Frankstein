{"instruction": "Explain the meaning of the given phrase in simple terms. Use an example if possible. It would be helpful if you could give an example.\n\n\"With a little give in them\"", "output": "The phrase \"with a little give in them\" is an idiomatic expression that means to have some flexibility or room for negotiation in a situation. It's often used to describe a situation where there's a small amount of wiggle room or leeway, where things can be adjusted or compromised without causing significant problems.\n\nHere's an example to help simplify the meaning:\n\nImagine you're buying a piece of clothing that's a bit too small for you. If the seller has \"a little give in them,\" it means they're willing to lower the price a bit or make a small adjustment to the size to make it fit you better. This is a minor adjustment, not a complete overhaul of the price or the clothing itself.\n\nSo, the phrase \"with a little give in them\" is a way to describe a situation where there's a small amount of flexibility or room for negotiation, allowing for minor adjustments to be made.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
