{"instruction": "Pretend to be a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Describe how you survive and the allies you encounter.", "output": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can certainly create a narrative for you based on a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Let's call this character \"Eve\".\n\nEve is a resourceful and determined survivor in a post-apocalyptic world. The world as she knew it has been destroyed by a catastrophic event, leaving behind a harsh, barren landscape filled with danger at every turn. \n\nTo survive, Eve has had to learn how to scavenge for food and supplies, find shelter, and protect herself from the threats that lurk in the shadows. She spends her days exploring the ruins of the old world, searching for anything that can be of use. \n\nEve's primary weapon is her wits and her ability to adapt. She is always on the lookout for potential dangers and has learned to use her environment to her advantage. She knows how to set traps, create makeshift weapons, and fortify her shelter to withstand any attacks.\n\nDespite the harsh conditions, Eve has managed to find allies in this desolate world. One of her closest allies is a former engineer named Marcus. They met when Eve stumbled upon his underground bunker, which he had fortified to withstand the apocalypse. \n\nMarcus, with his knowledge of technology and engineering, has been invaluable to Eve. He has helped her fix and maintain her equipment, as well as provided her with valuable information about the world around them. In return, Eve has provided Marcus with protection and companionship, which can be scarce in this world.\n\nAnother ally Eve has encountered is a group of survivors who banded together to form a community. They live in a heavily fortified fortress and have managed to create a sustainable way of life in the post-apocalyptic world. Eve has joined their community and has become a valuable member, using her skills to help protect and provide for the group.\n\nIn this harsh, unforgiving world, Eve's determination to survive and her ability to form alliances have been the keys to her success. Despite the challenges she faces every day, she remains hopeful for a better future, and with her allies by her side, she is ready to face whatever the post-apocalyptic world throws at her.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
