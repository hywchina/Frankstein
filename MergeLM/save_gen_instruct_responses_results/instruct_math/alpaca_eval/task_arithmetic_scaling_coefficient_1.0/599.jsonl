{"instruction": "Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.", "output": "In German, the ending of a verb does not change the meaning of the sentence. German verbs are typically placed at the end of a sentence, unlike English, where they usually come at the beginning. However, it's essential to understand that the German language has a complex system of verb conjugation, which means that the verb form changes based on the tense, person, and number.\n\nHere's a grammar tip on how to form the correct sentence with a verb in German:\n\n1. Choose the correct tense: German has three tenses: present (Pr\u00e4sens), past (Prateritum), and future (Futur). The tense of the verb will depend on the time frame you're referring to.\n\n2. Identify the person and number: German verbs change based on the first, second, or third person (I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they) and singular or plural (one, some, many).\n\n3. Choose the correct form: For each tense and person/number combination, there is a specific conjugation for the verb. For example, in the present tense, the conjugation for \"to go\" would be \"gehe\" (first person singular), \"gehst\" (second person singular), \"geht\" (third person singular), \"gehen\" (first person plural), \"gehst\" (second person plural), and \"gehen\" (third person plural).\n\n4. Place the verb at the end of the sentence: In German, the verb comes at the end of the sentence. So, you would place the conjugated verb after the subject and any objects in the sentence.\n\nRemember, the key to mastering German verbs is understanding the complex system of conjugation and practicing it regularly. The ending of the verb does not change the meaning of the sentence, but the correct conjugation based on tense, person, and number is crucial for accurate communication in German.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
