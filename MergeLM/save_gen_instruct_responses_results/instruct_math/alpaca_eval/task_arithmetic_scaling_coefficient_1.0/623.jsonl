{"instruction": "Identify all words that match the pattern given.\n\nH_AR_", "output": "The pattern given is \"H_AR_\". Let's break down the process of identifying words that match this pattern:\n\n1. The pattern consists of three letters: H, A, and R. \n\n2. The first letter, 'H', is a constant in our pattern. It doesn't change.\n\n3. The second letter, 'A', is also a constant in our pattern. It doesn't change.\n\n4. The third letter, 'R', changes according to the pattern. \n\n5. We need to find words that have this pattern of having a 'H' and 'A' in a row, and then an 'R'. \n\n6. Given that 'H' and 'A' are in the middle of the word, we can think of them as a single unit. So, we're looking for words where 'H' and 'A' together form a unit.\n\n7. If we combine 'H' and 'A', we get 'HA'. \n\n8. The only two words in English where 'H' and 'A' appear together and form a unit are \"HAR\" and \"HAY\". \n\n9. In \"HAR\", 'R' is the third letter. \n\n10. In \"HAY\", 'R' is the third letter. \n\nSo, the words that match the pattern \"H_AR_\" are \"HAR\" and \"HAY\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The words that match the pattern are \"HAR\" and \"HAY\".", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
