{"instruction": "Suppose I have 12 eggs. I drop 2 and eat 5. How many eggs do I have left?", "output": "Initially, you have 12 eggs. \n\nStep 1: You drop 2 eggs. To find out how many eggs you have left after dropping, we subtract the number of dropped eggs from the total number of eggs. So, 12 (total eggs) - 2 (dropped eggs) = 10 eggs. \n\nNow, you have 10 eggs after dropping 2 of them.\n\nStep 2: You eat 5 eggs. To find out how many eggs you have left after eating, we subtract the number of eaten eggs from the current number of eggs (which is 10 after dropping). So, 10 (current eggs) - 5 (eaten eggs) = 5 eggs.\n\nAfter this step, you have 5 eggs left. \n\nSo, the final answer is: You have 5 eggs remaining.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
