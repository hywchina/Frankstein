{"instruction": "Given a programming language and the name of a function, write a command to show how to use the function.\n\nLanguage: Python\nFunction: input", "output": "In Python, the `input()` function is used to get input from the user and return it as a string. Here's an example of how to use the `input()` function:\n\n```python\n# Example usage of the input function\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# The input function displays a message and then waits for the user to type something.\n# Whatever the user types is then stored in the variable 'name'.\n\nprint(\"Hello, \", name)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `input()` function is used to ask the user to enter their name. The string \"Please enter your name: \" is passed to the `input()` function to provide a prompt for the user. The `input()` function then waits for the user to type their name, and the typed text is stored in the variable `name`. \n\nFinally, the `print()` function is used to display a greeting message that includes the user's name, which is obtained from the `name` variable. \n\nSo, the output of this program would be: \"Hello, [user_name]\", where \"[user_name]\" is the name that the user typed.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
