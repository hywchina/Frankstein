{"instruction": "Predict how many stars the author will give to the restaurant from a Yelp review.\n\nThe reviews were great, but honestly i felt it was just ok. Seemed like a typical tourist spot were the food was mediocre. The service was ok, not great, but not the worst.\nThe bread was very good. I ordered the muscle fries. They had a sweet Vidalia onion flavor. No need for fries bc they were soggy wo much flavor. My boyfriend ordered a pesto chicken pasta and it was again mediocre.", "output": "As an AI, I cannot predict the exact number of stars the author will give to the restaurant based on this text alone. However, I can provide some insights based on the content of the review.\n\nFrom the review, it seems that the author had mixed feelings about their experience at the restaurant. They mentioned that the reviews were great, but they found the food to be mediocre and the service as okay, not great but not the worst. The bread was good, but the muscle fries were soggy and lacked flavor. The author's boyfriend's pesto chicken pasta was also described as mediocre.\n\nThe rating system on Yelp typically ranges from 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the highest rating. Considering the ambivalence in the author's review, they might give a rating that reflects their middle-of-the-road experience. \n\nIf the author wants to provide a balanced review, they might give a rating that is neither extremely high nor extremely low. Therefore, a possible rating could be around 3 or 4 stars, which indicates an average to above-average experience. \n\nHowever, without a specific number mentioned in the review or additional information about the author's preferences, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact number of stars the author will give to the restaurant.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
