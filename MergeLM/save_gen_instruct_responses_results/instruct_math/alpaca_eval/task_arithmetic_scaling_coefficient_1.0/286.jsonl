{"instruction": "Can you please provide me the names of the two players in the atomic bomb game (in go)? \n\nIf you can get me the referee's name as well, that's even better!", "output": "The \"Atomic Bomb Game\" in the context of Go, a traditional Japanese board game, is a famous game played between two top-ranked players, AlphaGo and Lee Sedol. The game was played in 2016. \n\nHere are the names of the two players:\n\n1. AlphaGo: AlphaGo is an artificial intelligence developed by Google's DeepMind team. It's a computer program that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to play the board game Go at a world-class level. \n\n2. Lee Sedol: Lee Sedol is a South Korean professional Go player. He is one of the greatest Go players of all time and was the first non-Japanese player to achieve the rank of 9 dan in the game. \n\nAs for the referee, in the context of a computer program like AlphaGo, there isn't a traditional referee in the same way we think of one in human games. The game's fairness and outcomes are determined by the algorithms and rules of the game itself, rather than a human referee. \n\nSo, the names of the two players in the Atomic Bomb Game are AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, and there isn't a referee in the traditional sense, as it's a computer-versus-human game.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
