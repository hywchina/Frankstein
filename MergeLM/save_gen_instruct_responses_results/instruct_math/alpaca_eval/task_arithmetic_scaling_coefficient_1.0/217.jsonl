{"instruction": "I'm preparing a fun session with work colleagues in a tech company. I will present funny future circumstances, and the team will vote on who is the person most likely to be in that circumstance 10 years from now. The circumstances must be funny yet respectful and safe for work. Please help me come up with a few of these circumstances. To help you, please consider this example: \"In 10 years time, who is the most likely to have won the lottery\"", "output": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you come up with some funny yet respectful and safe for work future circumstances for your team-building session. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. \"In 10 years, who is the most likely to have invented a device that automatically feeds their pets while they're at work, but still can't get it to work on the weekends?\"\n\nThis scenario is funny because it plays on the idea of technology not being able to replace human care, especially on days when it's needed the most (weekends). It's also safe for work and respectful, as it doesn't target any specific individual or their personal life.\n\n2. \"In 10 years, who is the most likely to have become an expert in the field of 'virtual meeting etiquette' and written a best-selling book on the subject?\"\n\nThis scenario is humorous because it pokes fun at the idea of becoming an expert in something that might seem trivial or mundane. It's also relevant to the current work environment where virtual meetings are becoming more common.\n\n3. \"In 10 years, who is the most likely to have started a successful 'procrastination consulting' business, helping others manage their time better while still not being able to manage their own?\"\n\nThis scenario is funny because it takes a common human trait (procrastination) and turns it into a successful business. It's also safe for work and respectful, as it doesn't target any specific individual or their personal habits.\n\n4. \"In 10 years, who is the most likely to have become a 'champion of the office espresso machine', known for their ability to make the perfect cup of coffee under any stressful deadline?\"\n\nThis scenario is amusing because it highlights the importance of coffee in the workplace and the potential for a coworker to become a 'champion' of the office espresso machine. It's also safe for work and respectful, as it doesn't target any specific individual or their personal habits.\n\n5. \"In 10 years, who is the most likely to have become a 'master of the office thermostat', always adjusting the temperature to their liking, but never able to find the perfect setting for everyone?\"\n\nThis scenario is funny because it exaggerates the importance of office temperature and the potential for a coworker to become a 'master' of the thermostat. It's also safe for work and respectful, as it doesn't target any specific individual or their personal preferences.\n\nRemember, these scenarios are meant to be light-hearted and fun, so be sure to keep the tone playful and respectful during the session.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
