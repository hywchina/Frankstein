{"instruction": "Implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures.", "output": "To find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Compare each element in the first array with each element in the second array.\n2. If the elements are equal, print the element and its index in both arrays.\n3. Move on to the next elements in both arrays.\n\nHere's a Python program that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        if arr1[i] == arr2[i]:\n            print(\"Common element at index\", i, \"with value\", arr1[i])\n        elif arr1[i] < arr2[i] and i == 0 or arr1[i] > arr2[i] and i == len(arr1) - 1:\n            print(\"Elements are not present in both arrays at index\", i)\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"All elements are present in both arrays\")\n\n# Test the function with two arrays\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nfind_common_elements(arr1, arr2)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `find_common_elements` that takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as input. It iterates through the elements of both arrays using a for loop, comparing each element in `arr1` with the corresponding element in `arr2`. \n\nIf a common element is found, it is printed along with its index in both arrays. If the elements are not present in both arrays, a message is printed, and the function breaks the loop. If all elements are present in both arrays, a message is printed at the end.\n\nPlease note that this program assumes that the two arrays have the same length. If the arrays have different lengths, the program will not work correctly.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
