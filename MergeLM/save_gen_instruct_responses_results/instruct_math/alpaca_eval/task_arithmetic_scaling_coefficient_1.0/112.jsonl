{"instruction": "Is it true that the native Australians were really prisoners of England?", "output": "The relationship between the British and the Aboriginal people of Australia is complex and has been the subject of much debate and discussion. While it's not accurate to say that all native Australians were literal prisoners of England, it's important to understand the historical context and the impact of British colonization on the Aboriginal people.\n\nWhen the British arrived in Australia in the late 18th century, they established colonies and began to assert their sovereignty over the land. This led to significant changes in the lives of the Aboriginal people, who had been living on the continent for tens of thousands of years.\n\nThe British government's policies and actions often had a profound impact on the Aboriginal people, leading to displacement, loss of land, and significant changes to their way of life. Many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their homes and relocated to missions or reserves, which can be seen as a form of imprisonment or loss of freedom.\n\nAdditionally, the British government's policy of \"terra nullius\" (land belonging to no one) allowed them to claim the land for themselves, effectively taking it from the Aboriginal people without their consent. This policy was in place until 1966, when the Australian government finally recognized Aboriginal people's rights to their land.\n\nSo, while it's not accurate to say that all native Australians were literal prisoners of England, it's clear that the British colonization and subsequent policies had a profound and often negative impact on the Aboriginal people, limiting their freedom and autonomy. This complex history continues to shape the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the broader Australian society today.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
