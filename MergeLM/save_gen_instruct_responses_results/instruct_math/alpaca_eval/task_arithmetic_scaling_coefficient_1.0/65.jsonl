{"instruction": "How can I make bubble solution?", "output": "Making bubble solution is a fun and easy process that can be done at home using common household items. Here's a simple recipe for bubble solution:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 2 cups of water\n2. 1/2 cup of dish soap (preferably a non-toxic, biodegradable, and fragrance-free dish soap)\n3. 1 tablespoon of glycerin (optional, but it helps to increase the longevity of the bubbles)\n4. Food coloring (optional, for coloring the bubbles)\n\nInstructions:\n\nStep 1: Mix the water and dish soap\nIn a large bowl or a 2-cup measuring cup, combine the 2 cups of water and the 1/2 cup of dish soap. \n\nStep 2: Add glycerin (if using)\nIf you have glycerin, you can add 1 tablespoon of it to the mixture. Glycerin is a natural ingredient that helps to create more stable bubbles and can make the bubble solution last longer.\n\nStep 3: Stir the mixture\nUsing a spoon or a whisk, stir the mixture until the dish soap is completely dissolved in the water. This is important to ensure that the soap is evenly distributed throughout the water.\n\nStep 4: Add food coloring (if desired)\nIf you want to color the bubbles, you can add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture. Stir the coloring into the solution until the color is evenly distributed.\n\nStep 5: Store the bubble solution\nCover the bowl or measuring cup with a lid or plastic wrap and let the solution sit for a few hours or overnight. This allows the dish soap and water to fully mix and the solution to thicken, which will create better bubbles.\n\nStep 6: Use the bubble solution\nAfter the solution has sat for a while, it's ready to use. Dip a bubble wand or a straw into the solution and blow gently into it to create bubbles. You can also use a spoon to apply the solution directly to a flat surface and blow on it to create bubbles.\n\nRemember, the key to making good bubble solution is to use a high-quality, biodegradable dish soap and to mix it with water in the right proportions. The glycerin and food coloring are optional, but they can enhance the fun and aesthetic of your bubble-blowing experience.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
