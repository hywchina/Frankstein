{"instruction": "How do I wrap a present neatly?", "output": "Wrapping a present neatly can be a fun and creative process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you wrap a present neatly:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Size Paper**: The first step in wrapping a present neatly is to choose the right size of paper. The paper should be large enough to wrap around the present completely, but not so large that it's loose or wrinkled. You can choose a paper that's slightly larger than the present itself to allow for neat folding.\n\n2. **Gather Your Supplies**: Make sure you have all your wrapping supplies ready. These typically include wrapping paper, tape, a scissors, and a pen or pencil.\n\n3. **Position the Paper**: Place the present in the center of the paper, ensuring it's aligned with the folds in the paper. This will help you create a straight line to cut along.\n\n4. **Create a Crease**: Fold the paper in half and create a crease to serve as a guide for your cut. This will help you cut a straight line and ensure your wrap is neat and even.\n\n5. **Cut the Paper**: Using your scissors, cut along the crease you just made. This will give you a straight line to follow when you start wrapping.\n\n6. **Make the First Fold**: Fold the paper along the crease you just made. This will create the first part of your wrap. Make sure the fold is sharp and neat.\n\n7. **Wrap the Present**: Begin to wrap the present, starting from one end of the paper and working your way around the present. As you go, make sure to smooth out any wrinkles or creases as you go. You can use tape to secure the paper in place as you go.\n\n8. **Create a Neckline**: Once you've wrapped the present completely, create a neckline by cutting a small slit in the paper at the top of the wrap. This will allow you to insert a ribbon or gift tag later.\n\n9. **Finishing Touches**: Once you've wrapped the present completely and created the neckline, you can add a ribbon or gift tag. This will not only make the present look more festive, but it will also help to keep the wrap in place.\n\n10. **Final Check**: Before you finish, give the present a final check. Make sure all wrinkles are smoothed out, the tape is secure, and the neckline is neat.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to wrap a present neatly and effectively. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get the hang of it.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
