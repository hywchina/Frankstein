{"instruction": "can you write haiku for different inductive biases in deep learning models? start with attention", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to write a haiku about different inductive biases in deep learning models, starting with attention. Here's the haiku:\n\nAttention, the first bias,\nLearns to focus on what's most relevant,\nIn the data's vast sea.\n\nNow, let's move on to other inductive biases:\n\n1. Prior Knowledge:\nPrior knowledge, a guide,\nHelps the model learn with certainty,\nFrom what it's been taught.\n\n2. Hierarchical Learning:\nHierarchical learning,\nUnderstanding patterns at different levels,\nDeep insights it gains.\n\n3. Sparse Coding:\nSparse coding, a bias,\nEncourages simplicity and parsimony,\nIn the model's design.\n\n4. Autoencoders:\nAutoencoders, a bias,\nLearning to compress and reconstruct,\nEfficient representation.\n\n5. Generative Models:\nGenerative models,\nLearning the distribution of data,\nCreating new samples.\n\nPlease note that these haikus are not traditional in the sense that they don't follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern of traditional haikus. However, they aim to capture the essence of each inductive bias in a poetic and understandable way.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
