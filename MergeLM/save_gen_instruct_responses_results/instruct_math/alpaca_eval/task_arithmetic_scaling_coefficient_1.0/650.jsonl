{"instruction": "Recommend some helpful activities or conversation starters to use at meetups to break the ice.", "output": "Here are some fun and engaging activities and conversation starters that you can use to break the ice at meetups:\n\n1. Icebreaker Questions: Start with some simple questions that are easy to answer and can help people get to know each other. Some examples include: \"What's your name?\", \"Where are you from?\", \"What do you do for fun?\", etc.\n\n2. Two Truths and a Lie: Each person tells two true statements about themselves and one false statement. The others have to guess which one is the lie. This game can lead to some interesting conversations and insights.\n\n3. Speed Friending: This is a variation of speed dating, but in a group setting. Participants have a limited time to talk to each other and then move on to the next person. This can help everyone get to know multiple people quickly.\n\n4. Human Bingo: Create a bingo card with different traits or characteristics, such as \"has traveled to another country\" or \"speaks more than one language\". Participants need to find others in the group who fit these characteristics and get them to sign the corresponding square.\n\n5. Group Storytelling: Start a story and have each person add a sentence or two to continue the story. This can be a fun way to get everyone involved and laughing.\n\n6. Trivia or Quizzes: Organize a trivia or quiz related to a specific topic or general knowledge. This can be a great way to break the ice and create a competitive yet fun atmosphere.\n\n7. Team Building Activities: If the meetup is focused on a specific interest or hobby, incorporate some team-building activities related to that topic. For example, if the meetup is for a book club, have a short reading comprehension quiz or a discussion on a recent book.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make everyone feel comfortable and included. Encourage open and respectful communication, and be prepared to adjust the activities based on the group's preferences and dynamics.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
