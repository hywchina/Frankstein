However, I can provide you with a detailed description of how to create a simple ASCII man and a passage to help you memorize answers to questions on the topic of coordination.\n\n1. ASCII Man:\nTo create an ASCII man, you can use the following characters:\n- Head: `@`\n- Body: `o`\n- Arms: `oo`\n- Legs: `oooo`\n- Hair: `oooooo`\n\nCombine these characters to form the man: `@ooooooo`\n\n2. Coordination Topic Passage:\nHere's a passage to help you memorize answers to questions on the topic of coordination:\n\n\"Coordination is a fundamental concept in grammar that refers to the arrangement of words or elements in a sentence to convey a clear and coherent meaning. It involves various principles such as conjunctions, adverbs, and word order. \n\n- Subordination vs. Coordination: Coordination is about balancing and connecting independent clauses or elements, while subordination is about one clause or element being dependent on another.\n  Example: In the sentence 'I walked to the store, but I forgot my wallet', 'I walked to the store' and 'I forgot my wallet' are two independent clauses coordinated by a conjunction 'but'.\n\n- Types of Coordination: There are three types of coordination - simple, compound, and complex. \n  - Simple Coordination: It involves joining two independent clauses or elements with a conjunction.\n  - Compound Coordination: It involves using a compound subject or object.\n  - Complex Coordination: It involves a subordinate clause.\n\n- Common Coordinating Conjunctions: Some common words that coordinate elements in a sentence include 'and', 'but', 'or', 'nor', 'for', 'yet', 'so', 'if', 'than', 'whether', 'which', 'who', 'whom', 'whose', 'he', 'she', 'it', 'we', 'us', 'them', 'your', 'our', 'their', 'my', 'your', 'his', 'her', 'its', 'their', 'then', 'therefore', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'before', 'until', 'while', 'once', 'again', 'still', 'just', 'only', 'into', 'through', 'out'.\n\n- Correct Word Order: The order of words in a sentence matters in coordination. The general rule is to place the subject before the predicate.\n\nBy understanding these concepts and practicing with various sentences, you'll be able to master the art of coordinating your thoughts and ideas effectively in your writing and speech.\"\n\nThis passage provides a detailed overview of the topic of coordination, including definitions, types, and examples. It also includes a list of common coordinating conjunctions and a general rule for word order in sentences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
