{"instruction": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "output": "The wavelengths of light emitted by metals do not directly depend on their temperature. Instead, the color of the light emitted by a metal is more related to its temperature, and it follows a specific order called the \"Bohr's Law\" or \"Bohr's Distribution Law.\" \n\nBohr's Law is a formula that describes how the energy of electrons in an atom is related to the temperature of the metal. It's used to predict the characteristic temperatures at which different metals glow, or emit light, when heated. \n\nThe formula is: T(t) = (t/T_0) * (E_n - E_t) / (h * c)\n\nIn this formula:\n- T(t) represents the temperature of the metal,\n- t is the energy difference between the electron's initial and final states,\n- T_0 is the characteristic temperature of the metal,\n- E_n is the energy of the electron in its initial state,\n- E_t is the energy of the electron in its final state,\n- h is the Planck's constant, and\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThe wavelength of the light emitted by the metal is determined by the energy difference (t) in the electron states, not by the temperature of the metal. This is because the energy difference is related to the Bohr's Law, not the temperature. \n\nSo, to find the wavelength of light emitted by a metal, one would need to know the specific energy differences (t) for different electron transitions in the metal, not its temperature. \n\nIn summary, the wavelengths of light emitted by metals do not directly depend on their temperature. Instead, they are determined by the energy differences in the electron states, which are governed by Bohr's Law. The temperature is more related to the color of the light, as it affects the energy levels of the electrons and thus the transitions between them.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
