{"instruction": "Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?", "output": "Hi there! It's great to hear that you've decided to keep a rat as a pet. Rats can make wonderful companions and are relatively easy to care for. Here's a detailed guide on how to house, feed, and care for your new pet rat:\n\n1. Housing:\n   - Cage: You'll need a spacious cage for your rat. A cage with a minimum size of 2x4x4 feet (or 120 cm x 120 cm) is recommended. This will provide enough space for your rat to move around and exercise.\n   - Bedding: Use a safe and absorbent bedding material like wood shavings, paper-based bedding, or a commercial rat bedding. Avoid using pine or cedar shavings as they can be harmful to rats.\n   - Accessories: Add some toys and accessories to keep your rat entertained. These can include chew toys, tunnels, and climbing structures. Make sure they are safe and secure in the cage.\n\n2. Feeding:\n   - Diet: Rats are omnivores and need a balanced diet. Offer a high-quality commercial rat food as the main staple, which should be available in pellet form. This food is specially formulated to meet all your rat's nutritional needs.\n   - Fresh foods: Supplement their diet with fresh fruits and vegetables. Good options include apples, bananas, carrots, broccoli, and spinach. Avoid foods high in sugar and fat.\n   - Water: Ensure your rat always has access to clean, fresh water. Change the water bottle or dish daily to prevent bacterial growth.\n\n3. Care and hygiene:\n   - Cleaning: Clean your rat's cage weekly. Remove all soiled bedding, wash the cage thoroughly, and replace the bedding with fresh material.\n   - Hygiene: Monitor your rat's health by checking for signs of illness, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or changes in behavior. Keep the cage clean to prevent the spread of germs.\n   - Exercise: Provide opportunities for your rat to exercise outside its cage daily. This can be done in a supervised environment, such as a rat-proofed room or a playpen.\n\n4. Healthcare:\n   - Regular vet visits: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian experienced in caring for rats. This will ensure your pet stays healthy and any potential health issues are addressed promptly.\n   - Vaccinations: If you plan to let your rat interact with other rats or go outdoors, consider getting a vaccination to protect against diseases.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to providing a happy and healthy home for your pet rat. Enjoy your new furry friend!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
