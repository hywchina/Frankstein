{"instruction": "I am going to make pumpkin pie for the first time.  Can you help me?", "output": "Of course! I'd be happy to help you make a pumpkin pie for the first time. Here's a simple recipe that you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 cup of pumpkin puree\n2. 2 large eggs\n3. 1/2 cup of milk\n4. 1/2 cup of heavy cream\n5. 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n6. 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon\n7. 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg\n8. 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger\n9. 1 pie crust (homemade or store-bought)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. If you're using a homemade pie crust, make sure it's fully baked and cooled before proceeding. If you're using a store-bought pie crust, you can skip this step.\n\n3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, heavy cream, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger until well combined.\n\n4. If you're using a hand mixer or stand mixer, you can beat the mixture on medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until it's smooth and creamy. If you're whisking by hand, you might need a bit more elbow grease to get it as smooth.\n\n5. Once the filling is smooth and well combined, pour it into the prepared pie crust.\n\n6. If you're using a homemade pie crust, you might want to cover the pie with a pie shield or foil to prevent it from browning too much during the first 20-25 minutes of baking.\n\n7. Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. You can check this by inserting a toothpick into the filling. If it comes out clean, the pie is done.\n\n8. Allow the pie to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. This will help the filling set and the flavors to meld together.\n\n9. Once the pie has cooled, you can serve it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for a delicious dessert.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any substitutions or variations on the recipe.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
