{"instruction": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "output": "Hops are added to the brewing process at different stages depending on the type of beer being produced and the desired flavor profile. Generally, hops are added during the following stages:\n\n1. **Adding hops to the boiling kettle**: This is the most common method of adding hops. Hops are added at the beginning of the boil to contribute bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer. The hops are boiled for a certain period, usually around 60-90 minutes, to release their oils and compounds that provide the desired flavor.\n\n2. **Dry hopping**: This is a process where hops are added to the beer after the boil, usually during the fermentation stage or after fermentation is complete. The hops are left in the beer for a certain period, usually a few days to a few weeks, to impart additional flavor and aroma. This method is particularly used for beers that require a more complex hop flavor profile.\n\n3. **Hop bursting or hop torpedoing**: This is a technique where hops are added at the beginning of the boil and then removed after a short time, only to be re-added later in the boil. This technique is used to balance the bitterness and flavor of the beer.\n\n4. **Hop infusion**: This is a method where hops are added directly to the mash tun (the vessel where the mashing process takes place) to infuse the beer with flavor and aroma. The hops are left in the mash for a certain period before the beer is boiled.\n\nIn summary, hops are added at different stages of the brewing process to achieve the desired flavor and aroma profile in the beer. The specific method and timing of adding hops can vary depending on the type of beer being brewed and the brewer's personal preferences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
