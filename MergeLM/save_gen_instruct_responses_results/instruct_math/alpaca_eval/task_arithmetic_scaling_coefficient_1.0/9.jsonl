It's a hearty, flavorful dish that is perfect for hosting guests. Here's a recipe for Kubdari:\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the dough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n- 1/2 cup warm water\n\nFor the filling:\n- 1 pound ground beef\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 1 clove garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric (optional, for color)\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n- 1 egg, beaten\n- 1/4 cup grated sulguni cheese (or feta or cheddar)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Start by making the dough. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the vegetable oil and warm water, and mix until the dough comes together. Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.\n\n2. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a separate bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion, minced garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix well.\n\n3. Add the beaten egg to the meat mixture and mix well. Then, add the grated cheese and mix again.\n\n4. Now, it's time to assemble the Kubdari. Divide the dough into 4-6 equal parts, depending on how large you want your Kubdari to be. Roll each part into a ball and flatten it slightly with a rolling pin.\n\n5. Place a spoonful of the meat filling in the center of each dough circle, leaving a border around the edges. Fold the edges over the filling, forming a half-moon shape, and press the edges together to seal the Kubdari.\n\n6. Brush the tops of the Kubdari with a little bit of water and bake in a preheated oven at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.\n\n7. Serve the Kubdari hot with a salad or a glass of wine.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Kubdari! This dish is sure to be a hit with your guests.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
