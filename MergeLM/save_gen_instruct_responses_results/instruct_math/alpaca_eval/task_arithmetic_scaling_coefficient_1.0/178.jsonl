{"instruction": "Is online casino legal in India?", "output": "The legality of online casinos in India is a complex issue. While there is no specific federal law that prohibits online gambling, individual states have their own laws and regulations. \n\nThe Public Gambling Act of 1867, which is the primary law governing gambling in India, does not explicitly mention online gambling. Therefore, it is not explicitly illegal. However, the act does give individual states the power to regulate or prohibit gambling within their borders.\n\nSome states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Nagaland have specific laws that prohibit online gambling, while others like Goa, Daman, and Sikkim have laws that allow for regulated online gambling. \n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court of India declared that fantasy sports, a form of online gambling, is a game of skill and not gambling, which has been a grey area in the country's gambling laws. This ruling has been used by some online casino operators to argue that their activities are legal.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the legality of online casinos in India is still a matter of debate and interpretation. The government has not yet passed any specific legislation to regulate or prohibit online casinos at the national level. \n\nIn conclusion, while there is no clear-cut answer to whether online casinos are legal in India, they are not explicitly illegal under federal law. The legality depends on the specific state laws and the interpretation of these laws. It's always recommended to consult with a legal expert or do thorough research before engaging in any form of online gambling.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
