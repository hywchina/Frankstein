{"instruction": "What are the five most common causes of stress among people?", "output": "1. Work-related stress: This is the most common cause of stress. It can be due to a heavy workload, long hours, job insecurity, lack of control over work, or conflicts with colleagues or supervisors.\n\n2. Financial problems: Money issues, such as not having enough money, debt, or financial insecurity, can cause significant stress. This can also include worrying about how to pay bills, save for the future, or afford desired lifestyle.\n\n3. Relationship problems: Stress can arise from issues in personal relationships, such as marital or family problems, divorce, or conflicts with friends. This can include disagreements, lack of communication, or feeling unsupported.\n\n4. Health problems: Poor health, both physical and mental, can be a major source of stress. This can include chronic illness, pain, disability, or mental health conditions like anxiety or depression.\n\n5. Major life changes: Significant life changes, such as moving, getting married, having a child, or retiring, can cause stress. These changes can disrupt routine, create new responsibilities, and lead to uncertainty about the future.\n\nRemember, everyone experiences stress differently, and what causes stress for one person might not cause it for another. The severity and impact of stress can also vary greatly.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
