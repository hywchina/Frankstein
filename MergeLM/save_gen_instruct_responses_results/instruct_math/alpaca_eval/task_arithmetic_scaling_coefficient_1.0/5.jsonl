If your knife is dull, it will require more pressure, which can lead to slipping and accidents.\n\n2. **Choose the Right Grip**: The way you hold the knife is crucial. The most common grip for dicing is the \"V\" grip, where you hold the knife like the letter \"V\" with your index and middle fingers.
