{"instruction": "Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.", "output": "To find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming, we can use an approach where we store the Fibonacci numbers in a table and then use this table to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Here's a Python program that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    # Initialize the table to store Fibonacci numbers\n    fib_table = [0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)\n    # Compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib_table[i] = fib_table[i - 1] + fib_table[i - 2]\n    # The nth Fibonacci number is the last number in the table\n    return fib_table[n - 1]\n\n# Test the function\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The 10th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\nIn this program, we first define a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n` (since in the range of 0 to 1, the Fibonacci numbers are just the numbers themselves). Otherwise, we initialize a list `fib_table` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and then compute the rest of the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number by adding the two preceding ones. Finally, we return the last number in the `fib_table` as the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThe program then tests this function with `n = 10` and prints the result. Note that the output may vary depending on the value of `n`.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
