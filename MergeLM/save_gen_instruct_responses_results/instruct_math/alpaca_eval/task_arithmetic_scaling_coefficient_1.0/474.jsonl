The writer starts by expressing hope that the recipient, Jen, is doing well, which is a friendly and concerned tone.

The exclamation mark at the end of the sentence \"There's a coffee in it for you!\" is a bit informal and adds a touch of friendliness to the tone.\n\nOverall, the writer's tone is not disheartening, accusatory, worried, or disapproving. It's not particularly concerned, sad, regretful, or egocentric either. Instead, it's a mix of friendly, curious, and assertive. The writer is confident in their request and appreciative of Jen's help, while also offering a small reward (the coffee) to sweeten the deal.
