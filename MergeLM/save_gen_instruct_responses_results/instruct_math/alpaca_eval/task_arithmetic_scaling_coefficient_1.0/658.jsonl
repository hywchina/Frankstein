{"instruction": "The story of a movie has been described using many emojis. You need to guess the name of the movie based on the emojis.\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udcda\ud83e\udd85\u26a1", "output": "Step 1: Analyze the given emojis\nWe have four emojis: \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, \ud83d\udeaa, \ud83d\udcda, and \u26a1. We also have an additional \ud83e\udd85 eagle emoji which seems to be a part of the sequence.\n\nStep 2: Identify possible themes or actions\nFrom the emojis, we can identify a few possible themes or actions:\n- A person (\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f)\n- A vehicle (\ud83d\udeaa)\n- A book or knowledge (\ud83d\udcda)\n- A lightning bolt (\u26a1)\n- An eagle (\ud83e\udd85)\n\nStep 3: Look for a movie that incorporates these themes\nWe need to find a movie that includes a character (the person), a journey (the vehicle), a significant object or concept (the book or knowledge), a powerful event (the lightning bolt), and a unique element (the eagle).\n\nStep 4: Recall popular movies or stories\nWe can try to recall popular movies or stories that have these elements. For instance, we might think of the \"Harry Potter\" series, where the main character, Harry, is a wizard (\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f), he uses a broomstick as a vehicle (\ud83d\udeaa) to travel, the books are a central part of the story (\ud83d\udcda), and the lightning bolt scar on his forehead represents a powerful event (\u26a1).\n\nStep 5: Check if the sequence matches the movie\nThe sequence of the emojis could represent the initials of the movie title or a part of the story. In the \"Harry Potter\" series, the first four letters of the title are \"H.P.\" which matches the sequence of the emojis.\n\nStep 6: Provide the final answer\nBased on the analysis and matching of the emojis with the elements in the \"Harry Potter\" series, the movie title is \"Harry Potter\". \n\nSo, the rewritten answer is: The movie title is \"Harry Potter\".", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
