{"instruction": "I have two remote Debian servers, A and B. How can I copy a directory of files at `~/Documents/training_results` existing on server A to the path `~/training_results` on server B? I have SSH access on my local laptop to each of the servers, but neither of the servers have SSH access to the other.", "output": "To copy a directory of files from server A to server B, you can use the `rsync` command with SSH. Here's a detailed step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Understand the Process**: You are going to use `rsync` with SSH to copy a directory from one server to another. The `rsync` command is a powerful tool for remote synchronization, and when used with SSH, it allows you to securely transfer files between two remote servers.\n\n2. **Prepare the Commands**: First, you need to know the IP addresses or hostnames of both servers. Let's denote the IP address of server A as `A_IP`, server B as `B_IP`, and the directory on server A as `source_dir` (which is `~/Documents/training_results`). \n\n3. **Write the Rsync Command**: The rsync command to copy a directory over SSH is:\n\n   `rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key' --remove-source-files source_dir user@A_IP:~/training_results/ destination_dir`\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/private_key` with the actual path to your private key, `destination_dir` with the target directory on server B, and `user@A_IP` with your username and the IP address of server A.\n\n4. **Execute the Commands**: You can execute this command on your local laptop, which should have SSH access to both servers. The command will securely copy the `training_results` directory from server A to server B, overwriting the contents of the `training_results` directory on server B if they already exist.\n\n5. **Wait for the Process to Complete**: The `rsync` command will start copying the files. The progress of the transfer can be monitored using the output of the command. Once the transfer is complete, the `training_results` directory from server A will be available in the `~/training_results` directory on server B.\n\nPlease note that the actual commands will depend on your specific environment and the exact paths and keys you are using. Always ensure to handle sensitive information like private keys securely.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
