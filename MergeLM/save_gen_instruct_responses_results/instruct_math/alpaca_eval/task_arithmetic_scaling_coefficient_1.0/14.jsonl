{"instruction": "Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?", "output": "The tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving in the United States is deeply rooted in history and culture. The story of how turkeys became the official food of Thanksgiving is a blend of historical facts and myths. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **First Thanksgiving in 1621**: The most widely-held belief is that turkeys were part of the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. This was a harvest feast celebrated by the Pilgrims (early European settlers) and the Wampanoag Native American tribe. The Pilgrims, who were struggling to survive in the new land, had a successful harvest and wanted to express their gratitude. Venison (deer meat) was the primary food source for the Wampanoag, so it's likely that turkeys, being a common bird in the area, were included in the feast.\n\n2. **Turkey as a Symbol of Plenty**: Turkeys were a common food source for both the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. They were abundant in the forests and were relatively easy to hunt and farm. Therefore, it made sense to include them in the feast to represent the bounty of the harvest and the abundance of food.\n\n3. **George Washington and Thanksgiving**: In 1789, George Washington, the first President of the United States, declared a national day of thanksgiving. While he didn't specify what foods should be eaten, the tradition of turkey consumption was already established in many states.\n\n4. **Thanksgiving Becomes a National Holiday**: In 1863, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday. By this time, the tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving was widespread and deeply ingrained in American culture.\n\n5. **Marketing and Industrialization**: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the turkey industry in the United States grew and became more efficient. This made turkeys cheaper and more accessible, further solidifying their place in Thanksgiving traditions.\n\nSo, while it's challenging to pinpoint a single reason why turkeys became the 'official' food of Thanksgiving, it's clear that a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors contributed to this tradition.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
