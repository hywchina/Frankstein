{"instruction": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?", "output": "Once upon a time in a land not so far,\nThere was a tiny atom, no bigger than a car.\nIt had protons, neutrons, and electrons in tow,\nAnd these particles were quite busy, you know.\n\nThe protons and neutrons lived in the nucleus,\nThe central part of the atom, where all the action is.\nThey were quite friendly, but they had a rule,\nTo stay inside the nucleus, they never would fool.\n\nThe electrons, on the other hand, were quite spry,\nThey orbited the nucleus, up in the sky.\nThey didn't weigh much, but they had a big role,\nIn the atom's balance, they played a crucial soul.\n\nOne day, a scientist named Dr. Seuss (not the writer, a different one),\nWas studying these atoms, trying to find some new sign.\nHe discovered that when atoms were split apart,\nThey released a huge energy, a nuclear reaction in the heart.\n\nThis was a big deal, a major breakthrough,\nIt could create power, or so it seemed to do.\nBut it also had a darker side, a danger so real,\nWhen not controlled, it could cause a terrible deal.\n\nSo, Dr. Seuss and his team worked day and night,\nTo understand these atoms, to make things right.\nThey learned about neutrons, protons, and electrons too,\nAnd how they interact, in a dance both old and new.\n\nIn the world of nuclear physics, there's much to explore,\nIt's a world of wonder, but also a world of roar.\nSo, let's respect these tiny atoms and their might,\nAnd use their power wisely, for a brighter, more delightful sight.\n\nThe end.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
