{"instruction": "You will need to guide this person through the scenario they have described for the interview.\n\nFinally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.\nWhew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.\nNow you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.\nWhen suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.\n\"What if we thought of the problem this way?\"\nYou feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:\n\"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!\"", "output": "As an AI assistant, I'm here to help you navigate this situation. If your interviewer throws you a curve ball and asks a question or provides a new perspective that makes you need to adjust your current solution, don't panic. Here's a step-by-step guide to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Stay Calm and Listen**: First and foremost, take a deep breath and listen carefully to what your interviewer is saying. Understand their new perspective and the changes they're suggesting.\n\n2. **Assess the Impact**: Evaluate how this new perspective or information might affect your current solution. Determine if you need to make significant changes to your algorithm, or if it's just a minor adjustment.\n\n3. **Adjust Your Thought Process**: If necessary, adjust your thought process to align with the new perspective. This might involve rethinking the approach you were taking, or the specific steps in your algorithm.\n\n4. **Explain Your Process**: If your interviewer asks you to explain your thought process, do so clearly and logically. Walk them through how you arrived at your current solution, and then how you would adjust it based on their new perspective.\n\n5. **Ask for Clarification**: If you're unsure about any aspect of the new perspective or how to adjust your solution, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This will help ensure you're on the right track.\n\n6. **Codify the New Solution**: Once you've adjusted your thought process and understand the new perspective, start coding your solution. Make sure to clearly document your thought process and any changes you made.\n\n7. **Test Your Solution**: After you've coded up your new solution, test it to ensure it works correctly and meets the requirements of the problem.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for a moment to think before responding. It's better to take your time to ensure you're providing a thoughtful and accurate response rather than rushing and potentially making mistakes. Good luck with your interview!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
