{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Israeli dishes. Can you give me a recipe Israeli Cheese Bourekas?", "output": "Certainly! Israeli Cheese Bourekas is a delicious and popular dish that combines the flavors of the Middle East with the comfort of a cheesy pastry. Here's a simple recipe to make them at home:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 can of bourek (flaky pastry, also known as strudel dough)\n2. 1 cup of grated cheese (such as cheddar or halva)\n3. 1/2 cup of ground meat (beef, lamb, or a combination of the two)\n4. 1 onion, finely chopped\n5. 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n6. 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper\n7. 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (optional, for a Middle Eastern touch)\n8. 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. If the bourek pastry is frozen, thaw it according to the package instructions. If it's not, you can proceed to the next step.\n\n3. Cut the bourek pastry into 4 equal parts.\n\n4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, salt, black pepper, and ground cinnamon (if using). Mix well until the onion is evenly distributed.\n\n5. Place one part of the bourek pastry on a flat surface and spread a layer of the ground meat mixture on top, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.\n\n6. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the meat layer, ensuring it's evenly distributed.\n\n7. Fold the edges of the pastry over the cheese and meat mixture, creating a square shape. Seal the edges by pressing them together with a fork.\n\n8. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the pastry for an golden, crispy finish.\n\n9. Repeat the process with the remaining three parts of the bourek pastry, using the same layers of meat, cheese, and egg wash.\n\n10. Place the bourekas on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n11. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Israeli Cheese Bourekas with a side of hummus or a refreshing salad for a complete meal.\n\nPlease note that the exact ingredients and spices may vary depending on personal preference and regional traditions. This recipe is a simple adaptation of the original dish, and you can feel free to adjust it to suit your taste.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
