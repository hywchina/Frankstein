{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to play ice hockey. Can you explain how the game works?", "output": "Of course! Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice with five skaters and a goalie on each team. The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by hitting a puck into the opponent's goal using a stick. Here's a detailed breakdown of the game:\n\n1. **Equipment**: Players wear ice skates, a helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and a stick. The puck is a rubber disc, and the goal is a net with a frame made of wood or metal.\n\n2. **Rinks**: The game is played on an ice rink, which is 200 feet (61 meters) long and 85 feet (26 meters) wide. The rink is divided into two parts: the neutral zone and the two teams' zones.\n\n3. **Gameplay**: The game starts with a face-off, where two players from opposing teams try to gain control of the puck in the center of the rink. The team with possession of the puck is called the offensive team, and they try to skate the puck towards the opposing team's goal.\n\n4. **Scoring**: A goal is scored when a player hits the puck into the opponent's goal using their stick. The puck must completely cross the goal line (the line across the width of the goal) for a valid score.\n\n5. **Penalties**: If a player breaks a rule, they can be given a penalty. This might include minor penalties (like tripping or holding), major penalties (like fighting or intentional injury), or game misconduct penalties (like very severe behavior). During a penalty, the player must spend time in the penalty box, leaving their team shorthanded.\n\n6. **Periods and Time**: The game is divided into three periods, each lasting 20 minutes in professional games (but can be less in youth or recreational leagues). The clock stops when the puck is out of play, like when it goes out of the rink or a penalty is called.\n\n7. **Winning the Game**: The team with the most goals at the end of all periods wins the game. If the score is tied at the end of the final period, the game is considered a tie (or \"draw\" in some countries).\n\nRemember, ice hockey is a physical sport and can be quite fast-paced. It's important to always prioritize safety and follow the rules to ensure a fun and fair game for everyone involved.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
