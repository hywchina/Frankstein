{"instruction": "Regex is a set of characters that define a search pattern. This kind of pattern is usually used by string-searching algorithms to find or replace strings or to validate inputs. Convert the natural english text to regex.\n\nMatch a valid ip address", "output": "To create a regex pattern that matches a valid IP address, we need to consider the format of an IP address, which is typically in the form of \"ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd\", where \"d\" represents a number between 0 and 9, and each \"ddd\" can be up to three digits.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the regex pattern:\n\n1. The first \"ddd\" represents the first three digits of the IP address. We use the character set \\d (which means digits from 0 to 9) and specify that it must appear exactly twice (i.e., \"ddd\") to represent the first three digits.\n\n2. The second \"ddd\" also represents the next three digits in the IP address. Similar to the first \"ddd\", we use \\d and specify that it must appear exactly twice, but with different positions in the address.\n\n3. The third \"ddd\" is the last three digits of the IP address. Again, we use \\d and specify that it must appear exactly twice, but in the third position.\n\n4. The \".\" is a literal dot, which is a part of the standard IP address format. It separates the three groups of digits.\n\n5. The last \".\" is another literal dot, which separates the three groups of three digits.\n\nSo, combining these elements, we create the regex pattern:\n\n^(\\d{3}.){3}\\d{3}$\n\nHere's what each part of the pattern means:\n- ^ and $ are anchors that match the start and end of the string, ensuring that the entire string matched is a valid IP address.\n- (\\d{3}.){3} matches three groups of a digit (from 0 to 9) followed by a dot.\n- \\d{3} matches the last three digits, ensuring that the IP address has exactly three sets of three digits.\n\nSo, the final regex pattern that matches a valid IP address is:\n\n^(\\d{3}.){3}\\d{3}$", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
