{"instruction": "63-year-old male with diabetes for seven to eight years (BbA1c consistently between 5.9-6.5, fasting blood sugar around 7, other times high between 8-9-9.5, no low blood sugar). CKD for five years (starting with 24-hour urine protein within 200, GFR around 100, but in the last 1-2 years urine protein between 300-400mg, GFR between 60-70, most recent one being 56).

Avoid or delay dialysis if possible. Are there any other exams that need to be done? What are the recommendations for exercise and diet in addition to medication? When should the above medication be switched to insulin due to CKD?<br>", "output": "I am not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general advice and recommendations based on the information you provided. You should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n1. Medication and Treatment Options:\nYour current medications include Allisartan, Dapagliflozin, Metformin, and Pancreatic kininogenase enteric-coated Tablets. These are commonly used for managing diabetes and kidney disease. However, if you haven't already, your healthcare provider may consider prescribing an SGLT-2 inhibitor (like empagliflozin or canagliflozin) along with metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (like sitagliptin or saxagliptin) to help manage blood sugar levels and potentially delay the progression of kidney disease.\n\n2. Exams and Monitoring:\nRegular monitoring of kidney function, blood sugar levels, and proteinuria (examining urine for protein) is crucial. Additional tests may include a 24-hour urine protein test, a kidney biopsy, and a bone mineral density test (if not done already) to assess the progression of CKD and potential complications.\n\n3. Exercise and Diet:\nA balanced diet low in salt, fat, and sugar is recommended for managing diabetes and CKD. Regular physical activity can help improve blood sugar control and overall health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises.\n\n4. Switching to Insulin:\nThe decision to switch from oral medications to insulin should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider. Factors such as blood sugar control, side effects, and the progression of kidney disease will be considered. Generally, if oral medications are no longer effective or cause significant side effects, insulin therapy may be recommended.\n\nRemember, this is general advice. You should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
