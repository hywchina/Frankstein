{"instruction": "I have a project due in 2 weeks, that will determine if I get my diploma. And I'm nowhere near the end of it. However I just spent an entire afternoon labelling prompts on Open Assistant. Am I going in the right direction?", "output": "As an AI, I'm here to help you with any questions or tasks you have, but I must remind you that your primary focus should be on your project that will determine if you get your diploma. Spending time on labeling prompts for me, while helpful, should not take away from the time and effort you need to dedicate to your project.\n\nIt's important to manage your time effectively and prioritize your diploma project. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. Set a specific schedule for your project: Break down the project into smaller tasks and set deadlines for each task. This will help you stay on track and ensure you're making progress.\n2. Allocate time for other tasks: In addition to your diploma project, you should also set aside some time each day or week to help with tasks like labeling prompts for me. This will help you maintain a balance between your project and other responsibilities.\n3. Stay focused: Minimize distractions and ensure you're dedicating the time you allocate for your project to working on it. This might mean turning off notifications, finding a quiet workspace, or using tools to block distracting websites.\n4. Seek help if needed: If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure about any aspect of your project, don't hesitate to ask for help. This could be from a teacher, a tutor, a classmate, or even me.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to complete your project to the best of your ability within the given time frame. Good luck with your project and feel free to ask if you need any assistance!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
