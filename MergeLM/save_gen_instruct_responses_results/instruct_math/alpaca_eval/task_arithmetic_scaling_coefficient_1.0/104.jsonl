{"instruction": "Can you tell me how to make chocolate chip cookies?", "output": "Of course! Here's a classic recipe for chocolate chip cookies that yields a delicious and chewy result:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n2. 3/4 cup white granulated sugar\n3. 3/4 cup brown sugar\n4. 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n5. 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour\n6. 1 teaspoon baking soda\n7. 1 teaspoon salt\n8. 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with a stand mixer or 4-5 minutes with a hand mixer. \n\n3. Add the vanilla extract to the butter mixture and continue to beat until well combined.\n\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. This is your dry mixture.\n\n5. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture (butter, sugar, and vanilla) and mix until just combined. You don't want to overmix, as this can cause the cookies to become tough.\n\n6. Fold in the chocolate chips. They will be well mixed into the dough, but if you want to get a bit of a chocolate chip in every bite, make sure they're evenly distributed.\n\n7. Scoop the dough into 1-2 tablespoon sized balls (your preference for size). This will give you a more consistent cookie shape when baked.\n\n8. Place the balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie to allow for even baking and cooling.\n\n9. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The center of the cookies should still appear slightly undercooked. This is because the cookies will continue to cook a bit after you remove them from the oven, resulting in a chewy center.\n\n10. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. This will allow the cookies to set slightly and make them easier to transfer to a wire rack for complete cooling.\n\n11. Once cooled, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling completely. This will help to prevent the cookies from becoming soggy.\n\n12. Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies! They're perfect for snacking, packing in lunches, or sharing with friends and family.\n\nRemember, the key to the perfect chocolate chip cookie is not to overbake them. You want that chewy center, so keep an eye on them towards the end of the baking time.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
