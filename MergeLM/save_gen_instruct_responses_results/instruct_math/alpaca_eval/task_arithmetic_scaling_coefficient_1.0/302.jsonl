{"instruction": "I heard something about a number of British folks being deceived into believing that spaghetti grows on trees. Is this real? If so, how were they able to be drawn into a deception like this?", "output": "Yes, the story you're referring to is real. It's known as the \"Spaghetti Tree Hoax\" or the \"Panorama Hoax.\" It was a prank that aired on April 1, 1957, on the BBC's Panorama current affairs program. \n\nThe hoax was conducted by the BBC in conjunction with the Italian newsreel director Corrado Giaquinto. They created a 3-minute segment showing footage of a family in Switzerland harvesting spaghetti from trees. The segment was presented as a genuine news report, and the narrator explained that due to a mild winter, the spaghetti trees in Switzerland were producing an unusually large crop.\n\nThe deception was successful because it played on the public's lack of knowledge about the origins of spaghetti, which was a relatively new food in the UK at the time. Many people believed that spaghetti was a local product that could be grown in the UK, just like potatoes or carrots. \n\nThe BBC's decision to air the hoax on April 1, which was also known as All Fools' Day, added to the confusion. The hoax was not exposed until the following day, when the BBC announced that it was a prank. \n\nThe Spaghetti Tree Hoax is a classic example of how the media can influence public opinion and how people can be easily deceived when they don't have the necessary information or context. It's also a testament to the enduring power of the prankster spirit.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
