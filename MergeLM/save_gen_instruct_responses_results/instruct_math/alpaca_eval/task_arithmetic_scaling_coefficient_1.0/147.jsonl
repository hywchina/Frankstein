{"instruction": "define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op'", "output": "Sure, let's define a new language called \"Numeralish\", which is a combination of numbers and letters. In this language, we will use the first 10 numbers (0-9) and the first 10 letters of the alphabet (A-J). To create a word, you can combine these numbers and letters in any order. Here's a simple grammar for Numeralish:\n\n1. Words can be created by combining numbers and letters.\n2. The word starts with a letter, followed by zero or more numbers, and then more letters.\n3. The last word in a sentence must be a letter.\n\nNow, let's create some examples using the Numeralish language:\n\n1. A simple word: \"A1p\"\n2. A word with a number in the middle: \"B3eo\"\n3. A word with numbers on both ends: \"C2o4l\"\n4. A word with numbers and letters mixed: \"D0x5i\"\n5. A word with numbers on both ends and a space in between: \"E1p3o\"\n6. A word with numbers and letters in the middle: \"F2l4p\"\n7. A word with numbers on both ends and a space in between, and a special character: \"G0x2i\"\n8. A word with numbers and letters in the middle, and a special character: \"H3l3p\"\n9. A word with numbers on both ends: \"I0l4o\"\n10. A word with numbers and letters in the middle, and a space in between: \"J1p2i\"\n\nRemember, these are just examples, and the possibilities in Numeralish are endless. You can create any word you can imagine using these numbers and letters.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
