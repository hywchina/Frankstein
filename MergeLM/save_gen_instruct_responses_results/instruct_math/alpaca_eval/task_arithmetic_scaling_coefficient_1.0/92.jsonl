{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to learn to bake challah. Can you give me a recipe for that?", "output": "Of course! Challah is a traditional Jewish bread that is often braided and sweet. Here's a simple recipe for challah that you can try at home:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 1/2 cups of warm water\n2. 6-7 cups of all-purpose flour\n3. 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast\n4. 1 teaspoon of salt\n5. 2 tablespoons of sugar\n6. 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, melted\n7. 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.\n\n2. Add the remaining flour, salt, and the rest of the sugar to the bowl. Mix until a sticky dough forms.\n\n3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-15 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n\n4. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.\n\n5. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\n6. Divide the dough into 3-4 equal parts, depending on how large you want your challah braids to be. Roll each part into a long rope.\n\n7. Make a challah braid by taking three strands of dough and arranging them in a braid shape. Tuck the ends under the loaf and brush with the beaten egg for a golden glaze.\n\n8. Repeat this process with the remaining dough parts.\n\n9. Place the challah braids on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\n10. Remove the challah from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade challah! This recipe makes one large challah, but you can easily double or triple the recipe to feed a crowd.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
