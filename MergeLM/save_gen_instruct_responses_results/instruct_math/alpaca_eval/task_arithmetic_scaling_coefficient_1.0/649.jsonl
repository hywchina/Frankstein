{"instruction": "Answer the question about the paper after reading it carefully.\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.\nQuestion: What is English constituency parsing?", "output": "English constituency parsing is a natural language processing task that involves analyzing a sentence to identify its grammatical structure. It's \"constituency\" because it's about identifying the \"constituents\" or the basic units of meaning in a sentence, which are typically the noun phrases and verb phrases. \n\nThe goal is to determine the syntactic structure of a sentence, which is the arrangement of these constituents. This is crucial for understanding the sentence's meaning and for tasks like machine translation, text-to-speech, and more. \n\nHowever, English constituency parsing is challenging because English has a complex structure. It's a \"free word order\" language, which means the order of words in a sentence doesn't follow a strict rule. This makes it difficult for algorithms to accurately identify the correct syntactic structure. \n\nMoreover, the output of a constituency parser is subject to strong structural constraints and is often significantly longer than the input. This is because in a detailed syntactic analysis, each constituent and its relationship to others needs to be clearly identified, which can result in a longer, more complex output. \n\nIn the context of the paper, the Transformer model is being tested for its ability to generalize to this task. The paper suggests that traditional RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not performed well on this task, especially when the amount of training data is limited. The Transformer model, with its unique architecture and attention mechanism, is being evaluated to see if it can overcome these challenges and achieve better results in English constituency parsing.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
