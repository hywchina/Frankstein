Here's a simple recipe for Tong Sui that you can try at home:\n\nIngredients:\n1. 1 cup of mung beans\n2. 2 cups of water\n3. 1 tablespoon of rock sugar\n4. 1 tablespoon of dried longan fruit (optional, but highly recommended for the authentic taste)\n5. 1 tablespoon of dried red dates\n6. 1 tablespoon of wolfberry (also known as goji berries)\n7. 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, sliced\n8. 1 tablespoon of cinnamon powder\n9. 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper\n10. 2 cups of water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Rinse the mung beans thoroughly and soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n\n2. Drain the water from the mung beans and place them in a pot with 2 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 1 hour, or until the mung beans are tender.\n\n3. While the mung beans are cooking, prepare the other ingredients.

Once the mung beans are cooked, add the rock sugar, dried longan fruit (if using), dried red dates, wolfberry, ginger, and cinnamon powder to the pot. Stir well to combine.\n\n5.
