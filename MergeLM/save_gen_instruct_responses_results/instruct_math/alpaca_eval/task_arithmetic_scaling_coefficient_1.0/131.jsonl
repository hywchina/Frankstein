{"instruction": "List the layers of the TCP/IP model and for each layer identify one protocol.", "output": "The TCP/IP model, or the Internet Protocol Suite, is a set of protocols used for communicating over the internet. It consists of four layers: the Application Layer, the Transport Layer, the Internet Layer, and the Link Layer. Let's identify one protocol for each layer:\n\n1. Application Layer: This layer is responsible for providing network services to the user. One of the most common protocols in this layer is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is used for web browsing.\n\n2. Transport Layer: This layer ensures the reliable end-to-end delivery of data. A protocol in this layer is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides a connection-oriented service for reliable data transfer.\n\n3. Internet Layer: This layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks. The main protocol in this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides logical addressing and routing for the internet.\n\n4. Link Layer: This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a network. An example protocol in this layer is the Ethernet protocol, which is used for local area networks (LANs) and provides a way for devices to communicate with each other at the physical layer.\n\nSo, the protocols associated with the TCP/IP model are:\n- HTTP (Application Layer)\n- TCP (Transport Layer)\n- IP (Internet Layer)\n- Ethernet (Link Layer)", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
