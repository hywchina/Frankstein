{"instruction": "Hi. I want to make an embossed picture for my blind girlfriend. There is a Braille printer at my university that I can use. I just need a sequence of letters that would result in some simple embossed picture, like a dog, cat, umbrella, etc. Can you give me a such text?", "output": "Certainly! To create a simple embossed picture using a Braille printer, we need to represent each image as a sequence of dots. We'll use the 2x1 matrix for simplicity, which represents 2 rows of 1 column each. Each dot in the matrix represents a raised dot in the embossed picture.\n\nHere are the Braille representations of the simple embossed pictures you mentioned (dog, cat, and umbrella):\n\n1. Dog:\n   - Start with a line of dots (\u00b7), represent the body of the dog. You can adjust the length to fit the size of the dog you want to create.\n   - Add a short dash (-) for the head, and another short dash for the tail.\n   - The final sequence would look like this: \u00b7 - \u00b7 - \u00b7 - \u00b7 -\n\n2. Cat:\n   - Begin with a line of dots (\u00b7) for the body, again adjusting the length for the size of the cat.\n   - Add a short dash (-) for the head.\n   - Add another short dash (\u00b7) for the tail, but instead of extending it straight down, curve it a bit to the right to represent the cat's ear.\n   - The final sequence would look like this: \u00b7 - \u00b7 - \u00b7 - \u00b7 -\n\n3. Umbrella:\n   - Start with a long dash (|) for the vertical part of the umbrella. You can adjust the length to fit the size of the umbrella.\n   - Add a short dash (-) for the horizontal part of the umbrella. You may need to adjust the position of the dash to create the curve of the umbrella.\n   - Add a short dash (\u00b7) for the tip of the umbrella. You can place it on the right side of the horizontal dash.\n   - The final sequence would look like this: | - \u00b7 - \u00b7 -\n\nRemember that these are simplified representations. For a more detailed and accurate embossed picture, you might need to use a more advanced Braille system or a different method of embossing.\n\nPlease note that as a text-based AI, I can't physically create the embossed pictures, but I hope this helps you understand how to represent these simple images using a Braille printer.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
