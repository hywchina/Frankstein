{"instruction": "in billiards what happens if on the break every strip ball is pocketed?", "output": "In billiards, if all the stripes (solid-colored balls) are pocketed during the break shot, it's a situation known as an \"unusual inning\" or a \"call shot.\" This is a rule specific to the game of straight rail billiards, such as pool or snooker.\n\nIn this scenario, the player who is on the break is usually the one who commits the foul, as they are responsible for placing the cue ball (white ball) in play. However, if the player who committed the foul is the first player in the game, they would typically lose their turn. \n\nThe exact rule can vary depending on the specific billiards hall or the rules being followed, but generally, the player who was on the break would lose their turn. The next player would then come in, and play would continue as normal. \n\nIt's important to note that in some versions of billiards, the game might end immediately after the unusual inning, with the remaining balls being counted to determine the winner. However, this is not a universal rule and may not apply in all games.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
