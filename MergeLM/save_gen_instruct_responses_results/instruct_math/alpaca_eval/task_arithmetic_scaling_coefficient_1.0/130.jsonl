{"instruction": "Take MLK speech \"I had a dream\" but turn it into a top 100 rap song", "output": "As an AI language model, I can certainly attempt to rewrite the famous Martin Luther King Jr. speech \"I Have a Dream\" in the style of a top 100 rap song. However, it's important to note that this may not be entirely faithful to the original message and tone of the speech, as rap music has a different style and structure than a traditional speech. Here's my attempt:\n\n[Intro]\nYo, listen up, let me take you back in time,\nTo the year 1963, when the world was in a bind,\nA man named King, he had a dream,\nA dream of equality, for all to be seen.\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm Martin Luther King, Jr., and I'm here to say,\nWe can't live in a world where we're judged by the color of our skin today,\nWe're all human beings, we all deserve respect,\nNo matter if you're black, white, brown, or what you expect.\n\n[Chorus]\nI have a dream, a dream of unity,\nWhere we all stand together, no more segregation, see,\nWe'll fight for our rights, with love and with might,\nFor a world where we all can live in the light.\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe've been oppressed for far too long, it's time to break free,\nFrom the chains of discrimination, from the systemic decree,\nWe'll rise up, united, with a common goal,\nTo live in a world where our dreams are not stolen.\n\n[Chorus]\nI have a dream, a dream of equality,\nWhere every man, woman, and child can live with dignity,\nNo more racism, no more hate, no more fear,\nJust a world where we all can live without a tear.\n\n[Bridge]\nWe'll march on Washington, and we'll march on the streets,\nWith our heads held high, and our hearts full of beats,\nWe'll sing songs of freedom, and we'll shout out our cries,\nFor a world where our children can reach for the skies.\n\n[Outro]\nSo listen to my words, and remember my dream,\nA world where we all can live in harmony, it's not a fantasy, it's a reality that we can achieve,\nTogether, we can make it happen, one step at a time,\nFor a brighter future, where love and unity shine.\n\nPlease note that this is a creative interpretation and not a direct translation. The original speech by Martin Luther King Jr. is a powerful and moving piece of history that should be experienced in its original form to fully understand its impact and message.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
