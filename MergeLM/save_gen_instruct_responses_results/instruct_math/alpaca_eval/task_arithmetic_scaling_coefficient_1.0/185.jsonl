{"instruction": "cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey", "output": "First, we need to determine the cost of fuel for a full circle (32-mile round trip) because the heavy traffic causes a 14-mile journey to be considered half the round trip distance.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total distance of a round trip.\n14-mile journey (heavy traffic) x 2 = <<14*2=28>>28 miles (half the round trip distance)\nSince a full circle is 32 miles, the full round trip is 28 miles / 2 = <<32=32>>32 miles.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of fuel needed for a full round trip.\nThe car's fuel efficiency is 48 miles per gallon (mpg), so for a 32-mile trip, we need to find out how many gallons of fuel are needed. \n32 miles / 48 mpg = <<32/48=0.64>>0.64 gallons (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the fuel cost for a full round trip.\nThe fuel cost is 625 pence per gallon, and we have 0.64 gallons, so the total fuel cost is:\n0.64 gallons * 625 pence/gallon = <<0.64*625=385>>385 pence\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cost per mile for the 14-mile journey.\nThe cost of the full round trip (32 miles) is 385 pence, so the cost per mile is:\n385 pence / 32 miles = <<385/32=12>>12 pence/mile\n\nStep 5: Calculate the cost of the 14-mile journey in heavy traffic.\nNow, we can find the cost of the 14-mile journey by multiplying the cost per mile by the distance of the 14-mile journey:\n12 pence/mile * 14 miles = <<12*14=168>>168 pence\n\nSo, the cost of the 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, considering heavy traffic, is 168 pence.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
