We are given a fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which means that any real number's square is either zero (when it's a zero) or a positive number (when it's a positive number). \n\nNow, let's consider an integer k. By definition, an integer is a whole number, either positive, zero, or negative. \n\nWe can break down the integer k into these three parts: a positive integer (k), a zero (0), and a negative integer (-k). \n\nLet's denote the square of the positive integer as k, the square of the zero as 0 (which is 0), and the square of the negative integer as (-k). \n\nAccording to the given fact, the square of the positive integer (k) is non-negative because it's either zero (when k is zero) or a positive number (when k is positive). \n\nThe square of the zero (0) is zero, and the square of the negative integer (-k) is also non-negative because it could be zero (when -k is zero) or a positive number (when -k is negative but not zero).\n\nNow, we can add these three scenarios together: k (the original integer), 0 (the zero), and -k (the negative integer). \n\nSo, we have k + 2k + 1 (which is k + k + 1, or just 2k + 1) adding up all these values. \n\nTherefore, according to our initial definition of an integer, k (as an integer) and 2k (twice an integer) are always greater than or equal to 0. \n\nSo, when we add 1 to these two values (k + 2k), the result (2k + 1) is always greater than or equal to 1. \n\nHence, the statement \"For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 \u2265 0\" is proven to be true. \n\nSo, the final answer is: The statement is proven to be true because any integer k (whether positive, zero, or negative) results in a value that is always greater than or equal to 1 when k^2 + 2k + 1 is calculated.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
