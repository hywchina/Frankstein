{"instruction": "Why is it a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie?", "output": "The question seems to be a reference to the children's book \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" by Laura Numeroff and illustrated by Felicia Bond. In the book, a young boy offers a mouse a cookie, which leads to a series of events where the mouse asks for and receives various requests, ultimately leading to a big mess. The book is a humorous and exaggerated portrayal of the concept of hospitality and the idea that one small act of kindness can lead to a series of requests.\n\nHowever, in a real-life scenario, it's not inherently a bad idea to give a mouse a cookie. Mice are intelligent and social creatures, and they can be trained and kept as pets. Giving a mouse a cookie could be a part of their interaction and enrichment, especially if they've learned to associate the cookie with positive experiences.\n\nThe \"bad idea\" in the context of the book is more about the escalating demands and the chaos that ensues, not the act of giving a mouse a cookie itself. It's a light-hearted and imaginative story rather than a cautionary tale about real-life mouse behavior.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
