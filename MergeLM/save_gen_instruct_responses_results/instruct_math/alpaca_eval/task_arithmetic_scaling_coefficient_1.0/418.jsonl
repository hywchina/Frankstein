{"instruction": "What's the furthest back we can prove human existence? Is there good reason to believe it goes further then this point?", "output": "The furthest back we can prove human existence is a subject of ongoing research and debate in the field of archaeology and anthropology. Currently, the most widely accepted evidence of early human existence is from the fossil remains found in Ethiopia, which date back to approximately 2.8 to 2.9 million years ago. These fossils, discovered in the Afar Triangle, are classified as Australopithecus afarensis.\n\nHowever, there are ongoing efforts to push the timeline of human existence even further back. For instance, in 2019, a team of researchers claimed to have found the oldest known fossils of Homo sapiens in the world, dating back 300,000 years. These fossils were discovered in a cave in South Africa, and if the dating is confirmed, they would be the first known evidence of our species in Africa 300,000 years ago.\n\nMoreover, there are theories and speculations about the possibility of even earlier human existence. For example, some researchers have suggested that humans may have evolved in the Americas 250,000 years ago, which would significantly push back the timeline of human existence. However, these theories are still controversial and require more concrete evidence to be widely accepted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the most proven and widely accepted evidence of human existence dates back to 2.8 to 2.9 million years ago, there are ongoing efforts to find and date older fossils that could push this timeline further back. The furthest back we can prove human existence as of now is 2.8 to 2.9 million years ago, but there is good reason to believe that it could go further back, especially with advancements in technology and research methods.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
