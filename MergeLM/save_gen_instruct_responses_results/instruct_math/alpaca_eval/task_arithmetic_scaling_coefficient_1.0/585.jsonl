{"instruction": "Make a list of the materials that will be required to build the given tool.\n\nCoffee Darkness Meter", "output": "To build a Coffee Darkness Meter, you would need the following materials:\n\n1. Light Sensor: A light sensor is essential to measure the amount of light in the coffee. This could be a photoresistor or a photodiode, which changes its resistance or current flow when exposed to light.\n\n2. Arduino Board: An Arduino board is a small, single-board computer that can be programmed to read the output of the light sensor and provide the desired output. It will serve as the brain of the Coffee Darkness Meter.\n\n3. Breadboard or PCB: A breadboard or printed circuit board (PCB) is needed to mount the components and create a stable and secure connection between them.\n\n4. Power Supply: A power supply is required to provide power to the Arduino board. This could be a battery, a power adapter, or a USB cable.\n\n5. LED: An LED is needed to indicate the coffee's darkness level. It will light up in different colors or brightness levels based on the readings from the light sensor.\n\n6. Resistors: Resistors are crucial to control the current flow in the circuit. They are needed to protect the components from damage due to excessive current.\n\n7. Jumper Wires: Jumper wires are used to connect the components together on the breadboard or PCB. They allow for easy reconfiguration and testing of the circuit.\n\n8. Housing: A protective housing is necessary to enclose the electronics and make the Coffee Darkness Meter aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. This could be a 3D-printed case or a custom-made enclosure.\n\n9. Coffee Bean Tray: A coffee bean tray is required to hold the coffee beans for the measurement. It should be designed to fit the dimensions of the Coffee Darkness Meter.\n\n10. Coffee Beans: Of course, you'll need coffee beans to test the Coffee Darkness Meter. Different types of coffee beans will yield different readings, allowing you to calibrate the meter for various coffee roasts.\n\nRemember that the specific components and materials may vary depending on the design and requirements of the Coffee Darkness Meter.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
