{"instruction": "Write the HTML syntax for the required action.\n\nadding an image to the page", "output": "To add an image to an HTML page, you can use the `<img>` tag. Here's the basic syntax:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image_url\" alt=\"image_description\" />\n```\n\nThe `src` attribute is the URL or path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute is a description of the image for accessibility purposes. The `/` at the end of `src` and `alt` is not strictly necessary but is a common practice to separate the attributes from the tag.\n\nHere's an example with a URL for the image:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful sunset\" />\n```\n\nAnd here's an example with a local file path:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"/path/to/image.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful sunset\" />\n```\n\nRemember to replace the URLs or file paths with the actual paths to your images.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
