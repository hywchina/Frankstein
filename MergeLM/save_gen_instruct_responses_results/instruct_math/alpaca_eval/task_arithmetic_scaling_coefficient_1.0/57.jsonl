{"instruction": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Ukrainian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Okroshka?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Okroshka is a traditional Ukrainian cold soup that is typically served during the summer months. It's made with a variety of ingredients, including cucumbers, beets, potatoes, and boiled eggs. Here's a simple recipe for Okroshka that you can try at home:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 large cucumbers\n* 2 medium-sized beets\n* 2 large potatoes\n* 4 eggs\n* 1 onion\n* 1 carrot\n* 2 tablespoons of vinegar\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Sour cream for garnish (optional)\n* Fresh dill for garnish (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Start by preparing the vegetables. Grate the cucumbers, beets, and carrot. You can use a food processor or a grater for this. The goal is to get a fine grate for each of these vegetables.\n\n2. Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes. Also, hard-boil the eggs, cool them down, and then slice them in half lengthwise.\n\n3. In a large bowl, combine all the grated vegetables (cucumbers, beets, and carrot) with the cubed potatoes and egg halves.\n\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinegar, salt, and pepper. This will be your dressing for the salad.\n\n5. Pour the dressing over the vegetable mixture in the large bowl, and toss everything together until the vegetables are evenly coated with the dressing.\n\n6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to meld.\n\n7. Before serving, garnish the Okroshka with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh dill, if desired. This will add a creamy and flavorful touch to the dish.\n\n8. Serve the Okroshka cold, as it's best when chilled.\n\nThat's it! This recipe makes about 4 servings, so feel free to adjust the quantities based on the number of guests you're hosting. Enjoy your delicious Okroshka!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
