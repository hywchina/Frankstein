{"instruction": "How many black holes are known to exists at the time", "output": "As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, the exact number of black holes known to exist in the universe is not definitively known. However, astronomers and scientists have identified several hundred black hole candidates across the universe, both in our Milky Way galaxy and in distant galaxies. These include stellar-mass black holes (from about 1.4 to 10 times the mass of the sun) and supermassive black holes (millions to billions of times the mass of the sun), but the total count could be much higher. The search for black holes is an ongoing process, and new discoveries are being made through advanced observational techniques and space missions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
