{"instruction": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models", "output": "The dominant sequence transduction models are a class of artificial intelligence models that are used for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and other sequence-to-sequence tasks. These models are typically based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks. \n\nThese models have two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence. The performance of these models is often enhanced by the use of an attention mechanism, which allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence while generating the output.\n\nThe paper proposes a new network architecture called the Transformer, which is designed to address some of the limitations of existing models. The Transformer is based solely on attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, which are common components in traditional sequence transduction models.\n\nThe paper claims that the Transformer models achieve superior performance in terms of translation quality, parallelizability, and training time compared to existing models. Specifically, the paper reports that the Transformer model achieves a BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and a BLEU score of 41.8 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task. \n\nFurthermore, the paper demonstrates that the Transformer model can generalize well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, both with large and limited training data. This suggests that the Transformer model is not only effective for translation tasks but also has a wide range of applications in natural language processing.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a new network architecture called the Transformer, which is a simplified, attention-based model for sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer is claimed to outperform existing models in terms of performance, parallelizability, and training time, and it demonstrates good generalization across various natural language processing tasks.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
