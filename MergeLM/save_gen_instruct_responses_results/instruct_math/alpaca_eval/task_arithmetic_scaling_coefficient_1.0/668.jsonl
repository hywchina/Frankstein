{"instruction": "You are given a Python command and are required to convert it into Ruby.\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")", "output": "To convert the given Python command `print(\"Hello World!\")` into Ruby, you would use the `puts` method, which is the equivalent of the `print` function in Python. In Ruby, `puts` is used to output the string with a new line at the end. Here's the equivalent Ruby code:\n\n```ruby\nputs(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nSo, the final Ruby code is:\n\n```ruby\nputs(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this Ruby code, it will output:\n\n```\nHello World!\n```\n\nThis is the same as the output of the original Python code `print(\"Hello World!\")`.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
