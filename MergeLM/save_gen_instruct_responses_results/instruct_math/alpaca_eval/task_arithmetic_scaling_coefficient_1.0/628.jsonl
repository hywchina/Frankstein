{"instruction": "The last message in the chat is a partial response. You should complete and rewrite it.\n\n+ What are going to do now?\n- I don't know. I had to give up my dream of being a mathematician.\n+ Why", "output": "+ I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you had to give up your dream of being a mathematician?\n- It's a long story, but I'll try to keep it brief. I come from a family that values practicality and stability. My parents wanted me to become a doctor or an engineer, as they believed these professions would provide a secure future. They didn't see mathematics as a viable career option, even though I was passionate about it.\n\n+ That must have been difficult. Did you try to convince them otherwise?\n- Yes, I did. I explained to them how much I enjoyed mathematics and how I could see myself making a career out of it. However, they remained unconvinced. They argued that there were no job guarantees in the field of mathematics and that I would be better off in a more stable profession.\n\n+ What profession did they want you to pursue?\n- They wanted me to become a doctor or an engineer. They thought these professions would provide a more secure future.\n\n+ What do you want to do now?\n- To be honest, I'm not sure. I've always loved mathematics, but my family's expectations and the lack of support made me give up on my dream. Now, I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.\n\n+ It's never too late to pursue your dreams.\n- That's true, but it's not that simple. The path to becoming a mathematician is long and challenging, and I'm not sure if I have the determination and perseverance to go through it alone.\n\n+ You don't have to do it alone. There are people who can help and support you.\n- I know, but it's hard to find the right guidance and resources. I'm not sure where to start or who to turn to.\n\n+ You can start by talking to a career counselor or joining a support group. They can help you explore your options and provide guidance on how to pursue your dreams.\n- That's a good idea. I'll look into it. It might be the first step towards realizing my dream.\n\nThe answer is: It might be the first step towards realizing my dream.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
