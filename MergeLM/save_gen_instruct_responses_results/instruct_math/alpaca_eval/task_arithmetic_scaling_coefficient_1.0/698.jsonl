{"instruction": "Provide an ESRB rating for the following game.\n\nThis is an action-adventure game in which players help Kratos and his son on a dangerous quest. Players explore various realms and engage in frenetic hand-to-hand combat against human-like raiders and fantastical creatures (e.g., centaurs, trolls, dragons). Players use axes and chained blades to battle enemies, often resulting in large blood-splatter effects and dismemberment. Players can perform finishing attacks that depict close-up impalement via bladed and hand-held weapons; repeated axe strikes to a creature's neck results in decapitation. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the game.", "output": "The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) rating for the game you described would likely be M (Mature).\n\nThe M rating is given for games that are intended for players aged 17 and older due to the presence of intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content, and strong language. In this game, players engage in frenetic hand-to-hand combat, use axes and chained blades to battle enemies, and perform finishing attacks that result in large blood-splatter effects and dismemberment. Additionally, the game includes the use of strong language with words like \"f**k\" and \"sh*t.\" \n\nWhile the game's storyline involves Kratos and his son on a dangerous quest, the primary focus of the game is on the action and combat, which leads to the M rating.
