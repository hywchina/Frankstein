{"instruction": "Given that f(x) = 5x^3 - 2x + 3, find the value of f(2).", "output": "To find the value of f(2), we need to substitute x with 2 in the given function f(x) = 5x^3 - 2x + 3. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Replace x with 2 in the function:\n\n   f(2) = 5(2)^3 - 2(2) + 3\n\n2. Calculate the cube of 2 (2^3):\n\n   2^3 = 8\n\n   So, the equation becomes:\n\n   f(2) = 5(8) - 2(2) + 3\n\n3. Multiply 5 by 8:\n\n   5 * 8 = 40\n\n   The equation now is:\n\n   f(2) = 40 - 2(2) + 3\n\n4. Calculate 2 times 2 (2*2 = 4), but we have 2 in the original number, so we subtract 4 from the result:\n\n   f(2) = 40 - 4\n\n5. Subtract 4 from 40:\n\n   40 - 4 = 36\n\nSo, the value of f(2) is 36. \n\nIn conclusion, by following the step-by-step process of substituting x with 2 in the given function, calculating the new expressions, and performing the operations, we find that f(2) = 36.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "vicuna"}
