{"instruction": "Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "output": "The relationship between mathematics and art is a deep and varied one.

This article specifically focuses on the use of mathematics in visual arts.\n\nThe history of mathematics in art dates back to the 4th century BC, with the Greek sculptor Polykleitos using mathematical proportions in his work. The golden ratio, a concept often associated with aesthetics, has been a popular topic in art and architecture, although the evidence for its widespread use is not always reliable.\n\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, the use of the golden ratio in art was explored in depth by Luca Pacioli in his treatise \"De divina proportione\", which was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. The treatise discussed the use of the golden ratio in art and provided detailed explanations of how it could be applied.\n\nIn the modern era, artists like M. C. Escher and the De Stijl movement have used mathematical concepts to create their work. Escher, for instance, used tessellation and hyperbolic geometry in his prints, while the De Stijl movement embraced geometric forms in their art.\n\nMathematics has also influenced textile arts, such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, and Turkish and Moroccan carpet-making. In Islamic art, symmetries are a common feature, seen in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between mathematics and art is a rich and multifaceted one, with artists and mathematicians collaborating to create works of art that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also grounded in mathematical principles.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
