{"instruction": "You are given some reviews for a movie. Each video might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\n\nReview 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.", "output": "Positive Points:\n1. Innovative story\n2. Strong script\n3. Engaging characters\n4. Intense cinematography\n5. Important messages\n6. Great acting\n7. Unorthodox approach to conveying messages\n\nNegative Points:\n1.

The concept of creating chaos and joining a militant sect might not be the best solution for overcoming material shackles, according to some viewers.\n\nPlease note that the last point from Review 4 is not included in the list of negative points, as it is a personal opinion rather than a flaw in the movie itself.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
