{"instruction": "What is the james webb telescope", "output": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space observatory that will be the premier observatory for the next decade. It will take up residence in a halo orbit around the L2 point, about 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from Earth. The JWST will observe the universe in infrared light, with wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 microns, and will be able to see 100 times deeper than Hubble. It will be used to look back in time to the first stars and galaxies in the universe, study the formation of stars and planetary systems, and directly image exoplanets. The JWST is a joint project of the U.S. space agency NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
