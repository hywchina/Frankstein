{"instruction": "How to code the snake game in C that will be smooth and it will use images to animate whole level.", "output": "Creating a smooth snake game using C and images for animation is quite complex and involves several steps. Here's a simplified version of how you might start to approach this. Note that this is a text-based response, but the actual implementation would require programming in C and using a library like SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for handling images and animation.\n\n1. **Install the necessary libraries**: You'll need to install the SDL library, which is a software development library designed for creating games, multimedia applications, and other software that requires efficient access to low-level functionality. You can install it using a package manager like apt-get on Linux or a similar tool on Windows.\n\n2. **Initialize SDL**: In your C code, you'll need to initialize the SDL library. This will set up the necessary structures for handling graphics, input, and other features.\n\n3. **Load the snake image**: You'll need to create a function to load the image of the snake. This image should be in a format that SDL can handle, such as PNG or JPEG. You can use the SDL_Image library to load and manipulate images.\n\n4. **Create the snake**: Create a function to create the snake. This function should take the loaded image and use it to create a sprite that moves around the screen according to the game rules.\n\n5. **Create the food image**: Similar to the snake, create a function to load and create a sprite for the food. The food should also be an image.\n\n6. **Create the level images**: If your snake game includes multiple levels, you'll need to create images for each level and create functions to load and create sprites for each level.\n\n7. **Handle input**: Create a function to handle user input. This should check for key presses and mouse movements, and update the snake's position accordingly.\n\n8. **Update the game**: In your main game loop, you'll need to update the positions of all the sprites (snake, food, and possibly level elements) based on the input and game rules.\n\n9. **Draw everything on the screen**: After updating the positions, draw all the sprites on the screen using the SDL_RenderCopy function.\n\n10. **Repeat the loop**: Continue the game loop until the user quits or a certain condition is met (like the snake running into itself or the food being eaten).\n\nRemember, this is a simplified overview. The actual implementation will require a deep understanding of C programming, SDL, and possibly other libraries for image handling and game development. It's also important to ensure that your game runs smoothly by optimizing your code and managing resources effectively.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
