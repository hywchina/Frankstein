{"instruction": "What is Atlantis?", "output": "Atlantis is a mythological place described by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogues Timaeus and Critias. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and advanced civilization that existed in the distant past. The story of Atlantis is told through the character of the Athenian statesman Solon, who learned about the lost city from an Egyptian priest.\n\nPlato describes Atlantis as a island nation located beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\" (the modern-day Strait of Gibraltar), in the Atlantic Ocean. The city was said to be the center of a powerful empire that controlled much of the ancient world. The Atlanteans were said to be the descendants of the god Poseidon and lived in a highly advanced society, with advanced technology and a sophisticated system of government.\n\nHowever, Atlantis was said to have been destroyed in a catastrophic event, which Plato attributed to the greed and corruption of its inhabitants. The story of Atlantis serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of living a virtuous life.\n\nDespite the many attempts to find it, the exact location of Atlantis remains a mystery, and many scholars believe that it may be a metaphorical place rather than a literal one. Nevertheless, the legend of Atlantis has captured the imagination of people for centuries and continues to inspire literature, art, and popular culture.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
