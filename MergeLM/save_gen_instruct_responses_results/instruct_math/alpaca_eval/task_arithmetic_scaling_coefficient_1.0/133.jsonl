{"instruction": "convert December 21 \u00b7 1:00 \u2013 1:50pm pacific to asia/taipei time", "output": "To convert the time interval from December 21 \u00b7 1:00 \u2013 1:50 pm Pacific Time to Asia/Taipei time, we need to consider the time difference between the two time zones.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in hours and minutes between Pacific Time (PT) and Asia/Taipei (TZ) time.\n\n1. Pacific Time (PT) is 8 hours behind Asia/Taipei (TZ) because Taiwan is 8 hours ahead of the US West Coast.\n2. There is no need to adjust for daylight saving time since it doesn't change the number of hours between the two time zones.\n\nNow, let's convert the Pacific Time hours (1:00 - 1:50 pm) to the equivalent Asia/Taipei time.\n\n1. 1:00 pm Pacific Time is 1:00 + 8 hours = 9:00 pm in Asia/Taipei.\n\nNow, we can convert the 1:50 pm Pacific Time to the equivalent Asia/Taipei time by adding the 8-hour difference to 1:50 pm.\n\n1. 1:50 pm Pacific Time is 1:50 + 8 hours = 9:50 pm in Asia/Taipei.\n\nSo, the time interval from December 21 \u00b7 1:00 \u2013 1:50 pm Pacific Time is equivalent to December 22 \u00b7 9:00 \u2013 9:50 pm in Asia/Taipei time.\n\nThe rewritten answer is: The conversion of the given time interval from December 21 \u00b7 1:00 \u2013 1:50 pm Pacific Time to Asia/Taipei time results in December 22 \u00b7 9:00 \u2013 9:50 pm.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "koala"}
