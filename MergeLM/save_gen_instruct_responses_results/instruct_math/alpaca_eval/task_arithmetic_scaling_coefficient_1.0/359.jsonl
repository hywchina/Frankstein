{"instruction": "if it takes 8 hours to fly to Singapore, stop over for an hour and a half and then fly 14 hours to London then what is the total travel time if the plane is delayed in Singapore", "output": "First, we need to calculate the total flight time without considering the delay. To do this, we add the flight time to Singapore, the layover time (1.5 hours), and the flight time to London.\n\n1. Flight time to Singapore: 8 hours\n2. Layover time: 1.5 hours\n3. Flight time to London: 14 hours\n\nNow, let's add these times together:\n\nTotal flight time = Flight time to Singapore + Layover time + Flight time to London\nTotal flight time = 8 hours (Singapore) + 1.5 hours (layover) + 14 hours (London)\nTotal flight time = 23.5 hours (8 + 1.5 + 14)\n\nNow, let's consider the plane is delayed in Singapore. We don't have information about the duration of the delay, so we'll denote the delay time as 'x' hours.\n\nThe total travel time with the delay would be the sum of the total flight time without delay, the layover time, and the delay time 'x'.\n\nTotal travel time = Total flight time + Layover time + Delay time\nTotal travel time = 23.5 hours (without delay) + 1.5 hours (layover) + x hours (delay\n\nSince we don't have the exact value for 'x' (the duration of the delay), we can only express the total travel time as 23.5 hours + 1.5 hours + x hours. The exact total travel time will depend on the length of the delay.\n\nSo, the final answer is: The total travel time is 23.5 hours + 1.5 hours + x hours, with 'x' representing the duration of the delay in hours.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
