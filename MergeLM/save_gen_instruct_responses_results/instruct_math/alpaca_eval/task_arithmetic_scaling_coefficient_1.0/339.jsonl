{"instruction": "Can you make ASCII art? If so, can you show me a house?", "output": "Yes, I can create a simple ASCII art of a house. Here's a basic representation of a house using ASCII characters:\n\n```\n       .---.    .---.    .---.    .---.\n  .((.     .((.     .((.     .((.\n  .( /     .( /     .( /     .( /\n  . ))  . ))  . ))  . ))  . ))\n  .((.     .((.     .((.     .((.\n  .( /     .( /     .( /     .( /\n  . ))  . ))  . ))  . ))  . ))\n       .---.    .---.    .---.    .---.\n```\n\nThis art is not as detailed or complex as professional ASCII art, but it should give you a general idea of what a simple ASCII house might look like. Keep in mind that ASCII art is limited by the characters available on the standard keyboard layout and the creativity of the artist.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/task_arithmetic_scaling_coefficient_1.0", "dataset": "oasst"}
