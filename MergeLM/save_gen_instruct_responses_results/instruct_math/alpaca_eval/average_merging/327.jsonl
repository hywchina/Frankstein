However, I can provide you with some general information on the topic of false statements and falsified material.\n\nIn the United States, making false statements or falsifying material is a crime. It is illegal to knowingly make a false statement or representation to a federal agency or department, or to falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact. This is punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment.\n\nThe specifics of the crime and the punishment can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the false statement or falsified material. For example, if the false statement or falsified material is related to a federal matter, such as a federal investigation or a federal agency, the crime may be prosecuted under federal law. If it's related to a state matter, it may be prosecuted under state law.\n\nIn terms of the specific scenario you mentioned, it's possible that the individuals involved could be charged with making false statements or falsifying material.
