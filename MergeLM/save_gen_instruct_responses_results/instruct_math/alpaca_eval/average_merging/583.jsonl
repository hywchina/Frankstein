We want to see it!\nProjects must incorporate some kind of used materials - take that old used thing, and turn it into something new and different!\nE-waste is a huge problem. What can you make using old electronics and other salvageable electronic materials? \nWe have a special judges prize for our favorite Instructable that incorporates or is related to reusing e-waste.\nBe smart and be safe; note that potentially deadly projects (like Lichtenberg/fractal wood burning machines) will not be allowed to be published or submitted to this contest.", "output": "Here's an idea to help you win the challenge:\n\n1. Identify the materials you want to use: Start by collecting old, previously used materials such as plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, paper, metal cans, and electronic waste.\n\n2. Brainstorm ideas: Think about what you can create using these materials. For example, you could make a birdhouse, a planter, a lamp, or even a piece of furniture.\n\n3. Choose a project: Select one idea that you think will be feasible to complete within the given time frame and with the materials you have.\n\n4. Create a plan: Once you've chosen your project, create a detailed plan of how you will execute it. This should include a list of materials you need, the steps you will take to create the project, and any tools or equipment you will need.\n\n5. Execute the plan: Start working on your project according to your plan. Make sure to take pictures or videos as you go along to document your progress.\n\n6. Write an Instructable: After you've completed your project, write an Instructable that includes detailed instructions on how to make it. Be sure to include pictures and videos to help others understand the process.\n\n7. Submit your Instructable: Once you've written your Instructable, submit it to the contest. Make sure to include the hashtag #recyclecontest in the title and description to make it easier for the judges to find.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a great chance of winning the challenge and making something useful and creative out of old, previously used materials. Good luck!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
