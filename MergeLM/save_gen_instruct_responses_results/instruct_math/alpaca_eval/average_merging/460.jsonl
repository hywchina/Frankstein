{"instruction": "Can you tell me how to format an url in rst?", "output": "In reStructuredText (RST), you can use the `url` role to format a URL. Here's an example:\n\n```rst\nThe Python programming language is available at:\n\n.. url:: https://www.python.org/\n```\n\nThis will create a clickable link to the Python website in the output. You can also use the `raw` role to include a URL without making it clickable:\n\n```rst\nThe Python programming language is available at:\n\n.. raw:: https://www.python.org/\n```\n\nThis will display the URL as plain text in the output.\n\nYou can also use the `link` directive to define a custom link:\n\n```rst\nThe Python programming language is available at:\n\n.. link:: https://www.python.org/\n```\n\nThis will create a clickable link to the Python website in the output. You can use the `link` directive to define other types of links as well, such as email addresses or local files.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the reStructuredText documentation:\n\n* [reStructuredText Markup Language Specification](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html#url-roles)\n* [reStructuredText Markup Language Specification - Links](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html#link-directive)\n\nI hope this helps!
