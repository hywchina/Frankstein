{"instruction": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "output": "The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to release calcium ions is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). When a cell receives a signal from the outside, it can activate a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) or a tyrosine kinase receptor. These receptors can activate a phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nIP3 then binds to IP3 receptors on the ER, causing the release of calcium ions from the ER into the cytosol. This increase in cytosolic calcium ions can then trigger various cellular responses, such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, or gene expression.\n\nSo, the second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
