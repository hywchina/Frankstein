{"instruction": "How do I wrap a present neatly?", "output": "Wrapping a present neatly can be a fun and creative process. Here are some steps to help you wrap a present neatly:\n\n1. Choose the right wrapping paper: Select a paper that complements the gift and the occasion. You can choose from a variety of patterns, colors, and textures. Make sure the paper is large enough to cover the gift completely.\n\n2. Measure the gift: Before you start wrapping, measure the length, width, and height of the gift to determine the size of the paper you need.\n\n3. Cut the paper: Cut the paper to the appropriate size using scissors or a paper cutter. Make sure the paper is large enough to wrap the gift completely and to fold over the edges.\n\n4. Fold the paper: Fold the paper in half lengthwise to create a crease. This will help you align the edges as you wrap the gift.\n\n5. Place the gift: Place the gift on the paper, centered along the length of the paper. Make sure the gift is not too close to the edge of the paper, as this can make it difficult to wrap.\n\n6. Start wrapping: Begin wrapping the gift by folding one edge of the paper over the gift and taping it in place. Continue wrapping the gift, folding the paper over the gift and taping it in place as you go. Make sure to smooth out any wrinkles as you go.\n\n7. Finish wrapping: Once you have wrapped the gift completely, fold the remaining paper over the top of the gift and tape it in place. This will create a neat, finished look.\n\n8. Add a bow: To add a finishing touch, tie a bow using ribbon or string. You can choose from a variety of bow styles, or create your own unique design.\n\n9. Label the gift: Write the recipient's name and a message on the gift tag or directly on the wrapping paper. This will add a personal touch to the gift.\n\nBy following these steps, you can wrap a present neatly and creatively. Remember to have fun and be creative with your wrapping paper choices and bow designs.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
