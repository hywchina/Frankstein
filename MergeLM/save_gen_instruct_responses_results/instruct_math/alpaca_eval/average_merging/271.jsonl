{"instruction": "can you generate a data model for a test automation tool considering organizations, users, projects, goals (under projects), tests (under goals) and executions (of test cases). Each execution has a date and a passed or failed status.", "output": "Sure, I can help you create a data model for a test automation tool. Here's a suggested data model:\n\n1. Organization\n   - OrganizationID (PK)\n   - OrganizationName\n   - Address\n\n2. User\n   - UserID (PK)\n   - UserName\n   - OrganizationID (FK)\n\n3. Project\n   - ProjectID (PK)\n   - ProjectName\n   - OrganizationID (FK)\n\n4. Goal\n   - GoalID (PK)\n   - GoalName\n   - ProjectID (FK)\n\n5. Test\n   - TestID (PK)\n   - TestName\n   - GoalID (FK)\n   - TestType (e.g., Functional, Regression, Performance)\n\n6. Execution\n   - ExecutionID (PK)\n   - TestID (FK)\n   - ExecutionDate\n   - PassedStatus (e.g., Passed, Failed)\n\nThis data model represents the relationships between organizations, users, projects, goals, tests, and executions. The primary keys are marked as PK, and foreign keys are marked as FK. The relationships between the entities are established through the foreign keys.\n\nFor example, a user can belong to one or more organizations (1:N), an organization can have multiple users (N:1), a project can have multiple goals (1:N), a goal can have multiple tests (1:N), and a test can have multiple executions (1:N).\n\nThis data model can be used as a starting point for designing a test automation tool's database schema. You can add more details and attributes to each entity based on your specific requirements.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
