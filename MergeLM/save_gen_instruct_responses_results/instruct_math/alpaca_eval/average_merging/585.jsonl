{"instruction": "Make a list of the materials that will be required to build the given tool.\n\nCoffee Darkness Meter", "output": "To build a Coffee Darkness Meter, you will need the following materials:\n\n1. A small plastic or glass container with a lid (e.g., a mason jar or a small tupperware)\n2. Coffee grounds\n3. Water\n4. A small LED light (e.g., a keychain flashlight or a small LED bulb)\n5. A battery (e.g., a AA or AAA battery)\n6. A piece of paper or cardboard\n7. A pen or pencil\n\nHere's how to build it:\n\n1. Fill the container with coffee grounds, leaving about an inch of space at the top.\n2. Add water to the container until it is completely submerged.\n3. Place the LED light at the bottom of the container, making sure it is fully submerged.\n4. Close the lid of the container.\n5. Shine the light onto the paper or cardboard, and observe the darkness of the shadow it casts.\n6. Adjust the amount of water in the container to change the darkness of the shadow.\n\nThe darkness of the shadow will indicate the strength of the coffee. The stronger the coffee, the darker the shadow.\n\nNote: This tool is not scientifically accurate, but it can be a fun and creative way to estimate the strength of coffee.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
