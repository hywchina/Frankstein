{"instruction": "How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "output": "The average human blinks approximately 15-20 times per minute. To calculate the total number of blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider the average lifespan of a human, which is approximately 70-80 years.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of minutes in a lifetime.\nTo do this, we multiply the average lifespan (70 years) by the number of minutes in a year (60 minutes/year).\n70 years * 60 minutes/year = 4200 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of blinks in a lifetime.\nNow that we know the total number of minutes in a lifetime, we can multiply this by the average number of blinks per minute (15-20 blinks/minute) to find the total number of blinks.\n4200 minutes * 15-20 blinks/minute = 63,000-84,000 blinks\n\nSo, the average human blinks between 63,000 and 84,000 times in a lifetime. This number can vary depending on factors such as eye health, environmental conditions, and individual habits.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
