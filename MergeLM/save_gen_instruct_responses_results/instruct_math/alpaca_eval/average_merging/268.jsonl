{"instruction": "Marley has $20 left when she turns 21 years old. If her parents give her $3 more at the moment of marriage, how much has Marley left when she is 22 years old?", "output": "First, we need to determine how much money Marley has when she turns 21 years old. We know that she has $20 left at this point.\n\nNext, we need to consider the additional money that her parents give her at the moment of her marriage. The problem states that her parents give her $3 more. So, we need to add this amount to the money she already has.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Marley has when she is 22 years old. To do this, we add the money she had when she turned 21 ($20) to the additional money her parents gave her ($3).\n\nSo, the calculation would be: $20 (money at 21) + $3 (additional money) = $23.\n\nTherefore, Marley has $23 left when she is 22 years old.\n\nThe answer is: 23.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
