{"instruction": "Write the HTML syntax for the required action.\n\nadding an image to the page", "output": "To add an image to a web page using HTML, you can use the <img> tag. Here's the basic syntax:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"image-description\" />\n```\n\nThe `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of the image file. The `alt` attribute is used to provide a description of the image for accessibility purposes.\n\nFor example, to add an image of a cat to your page, you could use the following code:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat\" />\n```\n\nThis would display an image of a cat on your page with the description \"A cute cat\" for screen readers and other assistive technologies.\n\nYou can also use the `width` and `height` attributes to specify the dimensions of the image:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n```\n\nThis would display the image with a width of 200 pixels and a height of 150 pixels.\n\nNote that the `width` and `height` attributes are optional, and if you don't specify them, the browser will automatically adjust the size of the image to fit the available space.\n\nYou can also use the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to provide multiple image sources and sizes for different devices and screen resolutions:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat\" srcset=\"https://example.com/cat-large.jpg 2x, https://example.com/cat-small.jpg 1x\" sizes=\"(min-width: 600px) 200px, (min-width: 400px) 150px, 100px\" />\n```\n\nThis would display a large image of the cat on high-resolution screens, a smaller image on medium-resolution screens, and an even smaller image on low-resolution screens.\n\nFor more information about the <img> tag and its attributes, you can refer to the HTML specification: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
