{"instruction": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.  Go ahead and start a draft!", "output": "Once upon a time, in a New York high-rise co-op, there lived a group of immortal cats. They were not your ordinary cats, but rather, they were cats with a special gift - they could live forever.\n\nThe cats were led by a wise and benevolent leader named Whiskers. Whiskers was a sleek black cat with piercing green eyes and a regal demeanor. He had lived for centuries and had seen many things, but he had never lost his curiosity or his love for life.\n\nThe other cats in the group were equally fascinating. There was Fluffy, a white Persian with a fluffy coat and a sweet disposition. She was the mother of many kittens and was known for her kindness and generosity. Then there was Mittens, a scrappy tabby with a mischievous streak. She was always getting into trouble, but her playful antics brought joy to everyone around her.\n\nThe cats lived in a luxurious penthouse apartment on the top floor of the building. The apartment was filled with all the comforts a cat could desire - soft beds, scratching posts, and a never-ending supply of toys. The cats spent their days lounging in the sun, chasing each other around the apartment, and watching the world go by through the floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nOne day, a new cat arrived in the building. Her name was Luna, and she was a beautiful Siamese with striking blue eyes. She was shy and timid at first, but the other cats welcomed her with open arms. They showed her around the building and introduced her to all the amenities.\n\nLuna was fascinated by the cats' immortality. She had never met any other cats like them before, and she was eager to learn more about their secret. Whiskers, sensing her curiosity, took her aside and explained that they had been granted immortality by a powerful sorcerer many centuries ago.\n\nLuna was amazed and asked if there were any other secrets the cats knew. Whiskers smiled and said, \"There are many secrets in this world, Luna. Some are meant to be discovered, and some are meant to be kept hidden. But one thing is certain - life is a journey, and every day is a new adventure.\"\n\nAnd with that, Luna knew that she had found her new home among the immortal cats in the New York high-rise co-op.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
