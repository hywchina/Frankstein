Describe it as best as you can and also give me the stats of that Pok\u00e9mon.", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to design an electric Pok\u00e9mon for you! Let's call it \"Zapdos\".\n\nZapdos is a large, bird-like Pok\u00e9mon with a blue body and yellow wings. It has a long, pointed beak and two small, red eyes. Its wings are covered in feathers that generate electricity, which Zapdos can use to attack its opponents.\n\nHere are the stats for Zapdos:\n\n* Type: Electric/Flying\n* Height: 6'07\"\n* Weight: 220.4 lbs\n* Abilities: Static, Lightning Rod\n* Moves: Thunderbolt, Thunder, Aerial Ace, Roost\n\nZapdos is a powerful and intelligent Pok\u00e9mon. It is known for its ability to generate and control electricity, which it uses to attack its opponents. Zapdos is also very fast and agile, thanks to its flying type. Its Lightning Rod ability makes it immune to electric-type moves, while its Static ability makes it difficult for opponents to switch out.\n\nI hope you like Zapdos! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to design another Pok\u00e9mon.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
