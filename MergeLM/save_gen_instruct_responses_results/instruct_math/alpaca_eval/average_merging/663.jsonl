{"instruction": "Convert the given description to a bash command.\n\nread the first 10 lines from f", "output": "To read the first 10 lines from a file `f`, you can use the `head` command in bash. The `head` command is used to display the first few lines of a file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines. So, to read the first 10 lines from a file `f`, you can simply run the following command:\n\n```bash\nhead -n 10 f\n```\n\nThis command will display the first 10 lines of the file `f`. If you want to store these lines in a variable, you can use the `read` command in bash. The `read` command is used to read a line of text from the standard input and store it in a variable. So, to store the first 10 lines of the file `f` in a variable called `line`, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\nread -r line < f\n```\n\nThis command will read the first 10 lines of the file `f` and store them in the variable `line`. Note that the `-r` option is used to prevent backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
