{"instruction": "cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey", "output": "To calculate the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, we first need to determine how much fuel the car will consume for this journey.\n\n1. Calculate the amount of fuel consumed:\nTo do this, we can use the formula:\nFuel consumption = Distance / Miles per gallon (mpg)\nFuel consumption = 14 miles / 48 mpg = 0.29 gallons\n\n2. Calculate the cost of fuel:\nNow that we know the car consumes 0.29 gallons of fuel for the journey, we can calculate the cost of this fuel. We are given that fuel costs 625 pence per gallon.\nCost of fuel = Fuel consumption * Fuel cost per gallon\nCost of fuel = 0.29 gallons * 625 pence/gallon = 187.5 pence\n\n3. Account for heavy traffic:\nThe question states that there is heavy traffic for half of the journey. Since the journey is 14 miles long, the distance affected by heavy traffic is 14 miles / 2 = 7 miles.\n\n4. Calculate the additional fuel consumed due to heavy traffic:\nTo do this, we can use the same formula as before:\nAdditional fuel consumption = Distance affected by heavy traffic / Miles per gallon (mpg)\nAdditional fuel consumption = 7 miles / 48 mpg = 0.15 gallons\n\n5. Calculate the additional cost of fuel due to heavy traffic:\nNow that we know the car consumes an additional 0.15 gallons of fuel due to heavy traffic, we can calculate the additional cost of this fuel. We are given that fuel costs 625 pence per gallon.\nAdditional cost of fuel = Additional fuel consumption * Fuel cost per gallon\nAdditional cost of fuel = 0.15 gallons * 625 pence/gallon = 93.75 pence\n\n6. Calculate the total cost of the journey:\nFinally, we can add the cost of the fuel consumed during the journey and the additional cost of fuel due to heavy traffic to find the total cost of the journey.\nTotal cost = Cost of fuel + Additional cost of fuel\nTotal cost = 187.5 pence + 93.75 pence = 281.25 pence\n\nSo, the total cost of the 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, considering heavy traffic for half the journey, is 281.25 pence.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
