{"instruction": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "output": "The question of whether it is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence is a complex one that has been debated by philosophers and scientists for centuries.\n\nOn one hand, some argue that beliefs should be based on objective evidence, as this is the only way to ensure that they are true and reliable. This view is often associated with the scientific method, which relies on empirical evidence and logical reasoning to establish facts and theories.\n\nOn the other hand, others argue that beliefs can be rational even without objective evidence, as long as they are based on good reasons, coherence, and consistency. This view is often associated with the philosophy of religion, where many people believe in the existence of God or other supernatural entities despite a lack of objective evidence.\n\nIn practice, most people's beliefs are a combination of both types. They may hold some beliefs based on objective evidence, such as the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun, and others based on subjective evidence, such as their personal experiences or intuitions.\n\nUltimately, whether it is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence depends on the individual and the specific belief in question. It is important to critically evaluate one's beliefs and consider the reasons for holding them, whether they are based on objective evidence or not.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
