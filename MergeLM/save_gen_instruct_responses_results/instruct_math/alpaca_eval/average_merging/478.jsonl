I was thinking about how long it's been since we all got together, and I wanted to invite you all to my place for dinner this Friday. It's been a while since we've had a chance to catch up and share some good food and drinks.\n\nI'll be preparing some of my favorite dishes, including lasagna, garlic bread, and a delicious salad. I'll also have some wine and beer available for those who want to enjoy a drink or two.\n\nPlease let me know if you can make it by replying to this email. I'd love to have everyone there, but I understand if some of you have other plans. If you can't make it, please let me know so I can save you a spot for the next time we get together.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all on Friday!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
