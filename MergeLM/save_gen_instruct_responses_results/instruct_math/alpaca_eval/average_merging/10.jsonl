{"instruction": "do you think retinoid is effective on removing the acne? because I have a lot of it", "output": "Yes, retinoids are effective in treating acne. They are derived from vitamin A and are used to unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and prevent new acne from forming. Retinoids can be found in both prescription and over-the-counter products, such as adapalene (Differin), tretinoin (Retin-A), and retinyl palmitate.\n\nIt's important to note that retinoids can be irritating to the skin, especially when first starting to use them. This is a normal side effect and should subside after a few weeks of use. It's also important to use sunscreen daily when using retinoids, as they can make the skin more sensitive to the sun.\n\nIf you're considering using retinoids to treat your acne, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional to determine the best product and dosage for your specific skin type and condition.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
