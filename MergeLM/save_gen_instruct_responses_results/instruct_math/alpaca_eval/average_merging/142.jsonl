{"instruction": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. What do they each have to spend?", "output": "First, we know that Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister. Let's represent the younger sister's weekly budget as \"x\". Therefore, Navina's weekly budget would be \"x + $30\".\n\nNext, we know that Navina can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. The cost of the credit card is not specified, but let's assume it's \"y\". So, Navina's total spending would be her weekly budget minus the cost of the credit card, which is \"(x + $30) - y\".\n\nSince Navina's budget is more than her sister's, we can say that Navina's total spending should be greater than or equal to her sister's total spending. Therefore, we can write the inequality: \"(x + $30) - y >= x\".\n\nNow, let's solve this inequality for \"x\". First, we can add \"y\" to both sides of the inequality to isolate \"x + $30\" on one side: \"x + $30 >= x + y\". This simplifies to \"30 >= y\".\n\nNow, we know that Navina's total spending is greater than or equal to her sister's total spending, and we also know that \"30 >= y\". Therefore, we can say that Navina's total spending is greater than or equal to her sister's total spending plus $30. In other words, \"(x + $30) - y >= x + $30\".\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get \"x - y >= $30\". This means that Navina's sister has to spend at least $30 less than Navina to have the same total spending.\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of \"x\", we can't determine the exact amount that Navina's sister has to spend. However, we can say that Navina's sister has to spend less than Navina by at least $30.\n\nThe answer is: We don't know the exact value of x, but we can say that Navina's sister has to spend less than Navina by at least $30.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
