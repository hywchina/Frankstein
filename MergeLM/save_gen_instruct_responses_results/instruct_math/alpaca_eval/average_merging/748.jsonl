{"instruction": "As a superhero, how would you explain your origin story to a curious child?", "output": "Hello there, young friend! I'm so glad you're interested in my origin story. You see, I was once a regular person just like you, but one day, something very special happened.\n\nIt all started when I was out for a walk in the park. I was enjoying the fresh air and the beautiful flowers when suddenly, I heard a loud noise. I turned around and saw a big, shiny object falling from the sky. It was a spaceship!\n\nThe spaceship crashed into the ground right in front of me. I was a little scared, but I knew I had to help. I ran over to the spaceship and saw that the door was open. I peeked inside and saw a strange creature. It was small and had big, round eyes. It looked like it was hurt.\n\nI knew I had to help this creature, so I reached inside the spaceship and picked it up. It felt warm and soft in my hands. The creature looked up at me and smiled. I smiled back and then, something amazing happened.\n\nThe creature reached out and touched my forehead. I felt a strange tingling sensation, and then, I felt different. I felt stronger and faster. I could see better and hear better. I could even fly!\n\nThe creature told me that it was an alien from a faraway planet. It had come to Earth to find a hero who could help protect the planet from evil. The creature said that it had chosen me because I was kind and brave.\n\nFrom that day on, I became a superhero. I use my powers to help people and protect the Earth from bad guys. I'm so glad that I can use my powers to make the world a better place.\n\nSo, that's my origin story. I hope you enjoyed it! Remember, no matter who you are or where you come from, you too can be a hero. All you need is a little courage and a big heart.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
