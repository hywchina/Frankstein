{"instruction": "who was the black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement", "output": "There were several African American cabinet members who went on to play important roles in the civil rights movement. One of the most notable was Robert C. Weaver, who served as the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1966 to 1968. He was the first African American to serve in a presidential cabinet.\n\nWeaver was a key figure in the civil rights movement, advocating for fair housing and equal opportunity. He played a crucial role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing. Weaver also helped to establish the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was created to address issues of urban poverty and housing discrimination.\n\nAfter leaving the cabinet, Weaver continued to work on civil rights issues, serving as the director of the Office of Management and Budget and later as the administrator of the Federal Housing Administration. He was a founding member of the National Urban League and the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. Weaver passed away in 1997, but his legacy as a champion of civil rights and affordable housing continues to inspire generations of activists and policymakers.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
