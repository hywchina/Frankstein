{"instruction": "Hi, my cat just chewed on a small weed outside that looked like hairy bittercress.\nCould you check if this is toxic for cats?\nPlease also look for plants from the same family, as I'm not 100% sure I identified it correctly.", "output": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your question.\n\nFirst, let's identify the plant your cat chewed on. Hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta) is a common weed found in many parts of the world, including North America. It has small, round leaves and white flowers. If your cat chewed on a plant that looks like this, it's likely the hairy bittercress.\n\nNow, let's check if it's toxic for cats. Hairy bittercress is not considered toxic to cats, but it can cause gastrointestinal upset if ingested in large amounts. This means that if your cat ate a lot of it, they might experience vomiting, diarrhea, or other digestive issues. However, if your cat only chewed on a small amount, they should be fine.\n\nTo be extra cautious, you can monitor your cat for any signs of illness and contact your veterinarian if you notice any unusual symptoms.\n\nAs for plants from the same family, the hairy bittercress belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other plants that are safe for cats. Some examples include broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. However, there are also some plants in this family that are toxic to cats, such as mustard and horseradish.\n\nIn conclusion, if your cat chewed on a plant that looks like hairy bittercress and showed no signs of illness, they should be fine. However, if you're concerned or notice any symptoms, it's always best to consult with your veterinarian.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
