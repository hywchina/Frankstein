I am writing to discuss my current salary and to request a review.\n\nI have been working at [Company Name] for [Number of Years] years now, and I have been thoroughly enjoying my time here.

I believe that my contributions to the company warrant a salary increase.\n\nI would like to request a meeting to discuss this matter further. I am confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that reflects my value to the company.\n\nPlease let me know a convenient time and date for us to meet. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
