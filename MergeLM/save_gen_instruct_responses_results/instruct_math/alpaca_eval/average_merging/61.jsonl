First, you'll need to gather your materials. You'll need a needle, thread, the shirt, and the button you want to sew on.\n\n2. Next, you'll need to thread the needle. To do this, tie a knot at the end of the thread and then thread the needle.\n\n3. Now, you'll need to find the hole on the shirt where you want to sew the button. Once you've found the hole, place the button over it to make sure it's in the right spot.\n\n4. Once you've confirmed the button is in the right spot, hold the shirt in place with one hand. With your other hand, thread the needle through the button hole from the back of the shirt.\n\n5. Then, thread the needle through the hole in the button.\n\n6. Now, pull the thread through the shirt and the button until the knot is on the back of the shirt.\n\n7. Tie a knot on the back of the shirt to secure the button in place.\n\n8.
