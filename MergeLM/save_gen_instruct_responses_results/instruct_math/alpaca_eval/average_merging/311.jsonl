{"instruction": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "output": "The airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is a reference to a famous line from the movie \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" In the movie, a character asks, \"What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" and another character replies, \"What do you mean? An African or European swallow?\"\n\nThe question is a humorous example of an impossible question, as it is impossible to determine the exact airspeed velocity of a bird in flight. The answer is therefore, \"It depends on the species of swallow and the conditions of the flight.\"", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
