{"instruction": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I\u2019m a five year old", "output": "Sarcoidosis is a disease that affects the body's immune system. It causes small clumps of cells, called granulomas, to form in different parts of the body. These granulomas can cause inflammation and damage to the tissues around them.\n\nThe disease can affect different parts of the body, such as the lungs, skin, eyes, and lymph nodes. In the lungs, it can cause coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. On the skin, it can cause red, raised bumps or patches. In the eyes, it can cause blurry vision, sensitivity to light, and dry eyes. In the lymph nodes, it can cause swelling in the neck or under the arms.\n\nSarcoidosis can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. Doctors may use a combination of tests, such as chest X-rays, blood tests, and biopsies, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThere is no cure for sarcoidosis, but the symptoms can be managed with medications. Some people with the disease may need to take medication for a long time, while others may only need it for a short time. In some cases, the disease may go away on its own without any treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone with sarcoidosis is different, and the disease can affect people in different ways. If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor about the best way to manage the disease.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
