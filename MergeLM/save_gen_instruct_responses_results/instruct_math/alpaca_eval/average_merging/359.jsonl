{"instruction": "if it takes 8 hours to fly to Singapore, stop over for an hour and a half and then fly 14 hours to London then what is the total travel time if the plane is delayed in Singapore", "output": "First, we need to calculate the total flight time from Singapore to London. We know that it takes 8 hours to fly from Singapore to London, and there is a stopover of 1.5 hours in Singapore. So, the total flight time from Singapore to London is:\n\n8 hours (Singapore to London) + 1.5 hours (stopover) = 9.5 hours\n\nNow, let's consider the delay in Singapore. If the plane is delayed, the total travel time will increase. Let's denote the delay time as 'x' hours. So, the new total travel time will be:\n\n9.5 hours (flight time) + x hours (delay)\n\nSince we don't know the exact delay time, we can represent the total travel time as a sum of two parts: the flight time and the delay time.\n\nTotal travel time = Flight time + Delay time\nTotal travel time = 9.5 hours + x hours\n\nSo, the total travel time will be 9.5 hours + x hours, where x is the delay time in hours.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
