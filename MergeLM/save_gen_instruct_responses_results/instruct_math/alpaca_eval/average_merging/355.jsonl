{"instruction": "I am making mayonnaise, it was starting to thicken but now it has become runny and liquid again, is there any way to salvage it?", "output": "If your mayonnaise has become runny and liquid again after starting to thicken, there are a few things you can try to salvage it:\n\n1. Add more oil: The most common reason for mayonnaise to break is that there isn't enough oil in the mixture. Try adding a little more oil to the mixture and whisking it in. Start with a small amount (1-2 tablespoons) and gradually add more until the desired consistency is reached.\n\n2. Add more egg yolk: If you think the problem might be that the egg yolk wasn't fully incorporated into the mixture, try adding another egg yolk and whisking it in. This will add more protein and fat to the mixture, which can help thicken it.\n\n3. Add an acid: If the mayonnaise has broken because it was over-whisked or over-mixed, you can try adding a small amount of lemon juice or vinegar to the mixture. This will help stabilize the emulsion and thicken the mayonnaise. Start with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) and whisk it in.\n\n4. Start over: If none of the above steps work, it might be best to start over with a fresh batch of ingredients. This will ensure that you have the correct ratio of oil to egg yolk and that the mayonnaise has a chance to thicken properly.\n\nRemember, making mayonnaise can be a bit tricky, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't turn out perfectly the first time. With a little practice, you'll be making delicious homemade mayonnaise in no time!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
