Use the Eisenhower Matrix or other prioritization techniques to categorize your tasks based on their urgency and importance.\n3.

Use a planner, calendar, or time management app to stay organized and on track.\n4. Eliminate distractions: Identify and eliminate distractions that can waste your time. This may include turning off notifications, using a website blocker, or working in a quiet environment.\n5. Delegate tasks: If possible, delegate tasks to others who can help you complete them more efficiently. This will free up your time to focus on more important tasks.\n6. Take breaks: Regular breaks can help you recharge and maintain your focus. Take short breaks every hour or two, and longer breaks during the day or week.\n7. Learn to say no: Don't overcommit yourself by taking on too many tasks. Learn to say no to requests that don't align with your goals or that you can't realistically complete.\n8. Continuously improve: Regularly review your time management techniques and make adjustments as needed. Seek feedback from others and learn from your mistakes to improve your skills over time.\n\nRemember, time management is a skill that takes practice and patience. Don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Keep trying and adjusting your approach until you find a method that works for you.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
