{"instruction": "Is the US border open to Canada?", "output": "As of September 2021, the US-Canada border is still closed to non-essential travel due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This means that tourists and other non-essential travelers are not allowed to cross the border. However, essential travel, such as for work, education, or medical reasons, is still permitted.\n\nThe exact rules and restrictions may vary depending on the state or province you are crossing, so it's important to check the latest information from the US and Canadian governments before planning your trip.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security provides updates on the border status on their website, and the Canadian government also has information on their website about travel restrictions and requirements.\n\nIt's important to note that even if the border is open, there may be additional requirements for travelers, such as proof of vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, or quarantine requirements. These requirements can change frequently, so it's important to stay informed before planning your trip.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
