{"instruction": "I've recently started playing the turn-based strategy game Into the Breach. I have read online that the game is considered to have 'perfect information'. What is meant by 'perfect information' in this context?", "output": "In the context of turn-based strategy games like Into the Breach, \"perfect information\" refers to the fact that all players have complete knowledge of the game state at all times. This means that each player knows the exact position and status of all units and structures on the map, as well as the resources and abilities of their own and their opponents' factions.\n\nIn Into the Breach, for example, you can see the entire map and all the units and structures on it at any given time. You also know the exact range and damage of each of your units, as well as the abilities and weaknesses of your enemies. This allows you to make informed decisions about where to move your units, when to attack, and how to defend.\n\nIn contrast, some other types of games, such as real-time strategy games, do not have perfect information because the game state can change rapidly and unpredictably, making it difficult for players to keep track of everything that's happening. In these games, players often have to rely on their intuition and experience to make decisions, rather than having complete knowledge of the game state.\n\nSo, in the context of Into the Breach and other turn-based strategy games, \"perfect information\" refers to the fact that all players have complete knowledge of the game state at all times, allowing for more strategic and less chaotic gameplay.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
