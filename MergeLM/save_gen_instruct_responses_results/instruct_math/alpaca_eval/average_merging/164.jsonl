{"instruction": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called", "output": "Antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called isotropic antennas. Isotropic antennas are theoretical antennas that radiate energy equally in all directions. In reality, no antenna can be perfectly isotropic due to physical constraints, but some antennas come close to it. For example, a dipole antenna, which consists of two metal rods of equal length and orientation, can be considered isotropic in the far field, meaning at a distance far enough from the antenna that the radiation pattern is uniform in all directions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
