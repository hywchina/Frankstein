{"instruction": "is a bannana a fruit or a herb", "output": "A banana is a fruit. It is a type of berry, specifically a \"false berry\" or \"synconium,\" which is a fruit that has a fleshy outer layer but no inner seed-filled pulp. Other examples of false berries include grapes, tomatoes, and eggplants. Bananas are produced by a large herbaceous plant that is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plant is classified as a herb because it does not have a woody stem, but the fruit itself is still considered a fruit.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
