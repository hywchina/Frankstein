{"instruction": "What's the furthest back we can prove human existence? Is there good reason to believe it goes further then this point?", "output": "The furthest back we can prove human existence is approximately 300,000 years ago, during the Middle Pleistocene era. This is based on fossil evidence found in Ethiopia of a Homo sapiens fossil, known as \"Omo I.\"\n\nHowever, there is good reason to believe that human existence goes further back than this point. For example, there is evidence of stone tools and other artifacts that date back to over 2.5 million years ago, which suggests that early humans were present at that time. Additionally, recent genetic studies have shown that all modern humans share a common ancestor who lived in Africa around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, which further supports the idea that humans have been around for a much longer period of time.\n\nIt's important to note that while we have evidence of human-like species that lived millions of years ago, such as Australopithecus, we don't have definitive proof that these species were truly human. Therefore, the earliest definitive proof of human existence is around 300,000 years ago.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
