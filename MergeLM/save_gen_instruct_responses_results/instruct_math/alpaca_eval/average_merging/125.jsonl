{"instruction": "When was hip hop invented?", "output": "Hip hop is a cultural movement that originated in the Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s. It is characterized by four main elements: MCing (rapping), DJing, breaking (dancing), and graffiti art. The term \"hip hop\" was first used in a song by the group The Sugarhill Gang in 1979, but the roots of the culture can be traced back to the early 1970s.\n\nThe earliest form of hip hop was a type of music called \"disco rap,\" which was performed by DJs at parties and clubs. This music was characterized by its use of funk and soul samples, as well as its rhythmic, rhyming lyrics. In the late 1970s, this style of music evolved into what is now known as \"old-school\" hip hop, with groups like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation, and Run-DMC becoming popular.\n\nIn the 1980s, hip hop continued to grow and evolve, with the emergence of new styles like \"gangsta rap\" and \"new jack swing.\" During this time, artists like Public Enemy, N.W.A., and LL Cool J became influential figures in the genre.\n\nToday, hip hop is one of the most popular and influential forms of music in the world, with artists like Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and Cardi B dominating the charts. The culture has also expanded to include fashion, film, and other forms of art and entertainment.\n\nSo, while the term \"hip hop\" was first used in 1979, the roots of the culture can be traced back to the early 1970s, making it over 40 years old.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
