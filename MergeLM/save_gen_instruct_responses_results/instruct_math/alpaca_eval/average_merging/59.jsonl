{"instruction": "I've read the book \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius, a few times. I'm curious about the context, of when he wrote.", "output": "Suetonius, whose full name was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, was a Roman historian and biographer who lived from approximately 69 AD to 122 AD. He is best known for his work \"The Twelve Caesars,\" which is a collection of biographies of the first twelve Roman emperors.\n\nSuetonius was born in the city of Nagidos in Africa, which is now known as Suet, Tunisia. He was a member of the equestrian class, which was the second highest social class in ancient Rome. He served in various government positions, including as a secretary to the emperor Hadrian.\n\nSuetonius wrote \"The Twelve Caesars\" during the reign of the emperor Hadrian, who ruled from 117 AD to 138 AD. The book was written in Latin and is divided into twelve biographies, one for each of the first twelve Roman emperors. The biographies are not strictly chronological, but rather are arranged in order of the emperor's importance in Suetonius' view.\n\nThe book provides a detailed account of the lives of the emperors, including their personal habits, their relationships with their families and friends, and their political and military achievements. It is an important source of information about the early Roman Empire and has been widely read and studied by historians and scholars.\n\nIn addition to \"The Twelve Caesars,\" Suetonius also wrote other works, including \"On the Life of the Caesars,\" which is a collection of short biographies of the later Roman emperors, and \"On the Grammarians and Rhetoricians,\" which is a collection of biographies of famous Roman scholars.\n\nSuetonius' works are valuable sources of information about the Roman Empire and its rulers, and they continue to be studied and appreciated by historians and scholars today.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
