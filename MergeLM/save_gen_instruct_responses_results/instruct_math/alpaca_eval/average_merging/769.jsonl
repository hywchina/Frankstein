{"instruction": "How many text messages are sent globally in a minute? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "output": "It's difficult to provide an exact number of text messages sent globally in a minute, as there are various factors that can affect the number. However, we can make an estimate based on available data and trends.\n\n1. According to Statista, the number of global text messages sent per minute in 2020 was approximately 23 billion. This number is based on data from mobile network operators and other sources.\n\n2. The number of text messages sent per minute has been increasing over the years due to the growing number of mobile phone users and the increasing use of messaging apps.\n\n3. In 2019, the average number of text messages sent per person per day was 26.3, according to Statista. If we assume that this number is constant, and there are approximately 7.9 billion people in the world, then the total number of text messages sent per day would be approximately 207.7 billion.\n\n4. If we divide the total number of text messages sent per day by 24 hours, we get approximately 8.6 billion text messages sent per hour.\n\n5. Finally, if we divide the number of text messages sent per hour by 60 minutes, we get approximately 143.3 million text messages sent per minute.\n\nSo, based on these estimates and calculations, we can say that approximately 143.3 million text messages are sent globally in a minute. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and the actual number may vary depending on various factors.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
