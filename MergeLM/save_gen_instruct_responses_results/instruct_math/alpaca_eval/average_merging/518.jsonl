{"instruction": "How would you describe the meaning of this lyrics? Describe some of the metaphors.\n\nMy lover\u2019s got humor\nShe\u2019s the giggle at a funeral\nKnows everybody\u2019s disapproval\nI should\u2019ve worshipped her sooner", "output": "The lyrics you provided are from the song \"My Lover's Got a Gunslinger's Heart\" by The Civil Wars. The song is about a relationship where the speaker is in love with someone who is unconventional and doesn't follow the norms of society.\n\nThe first line, \"My lover's got humor,\" suggests that the person the speaker is in love with is someone who can find humor in any situation, even in the face of adversity. This is an important characteristic for the speaker, as it helps them deal with the challenges that come with being in a relationship with someone who doesn't conform to societal expectations.\n\nThe second line, \"She's the giggle at a funeral,\" is a metaphor that further emphasizes this point. The image of a giggle at a funeral is unexpected and incongruous, just like the relationship the speaker is in. It suggests that the person the speaker is in love with brings a sense of lightness and joy into their life, even when things are difficult.\n\nThe third line, \"Knows everybody's disapproval,\" acknowledges that not everyone approves of their relationship. This could be due to the fact that the person the speaker is in love with doesn't fit into the traditional mold of what society considers \"normal.\" However, the speaker doesn't care about what others think, as they are in love with this person and value their unique qualities.\n\nThe final line, \"I should've worshipped her sooner,\" is a reflection on the speaker's realization that they should have appreciated this person more from the beginning of their relationship. It's a recognition that they have found someone truly special and that they should have treated them with more respect and admiration.\n\nOverall, the lyrics describe a relationship that is unconventional and non-traditional, but also deeply loving and meaningful. The speaker values the unique qualities of the person they are in love with and is grateful to have found someone who brings so much joy and laughter into their life.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
