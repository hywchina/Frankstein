{"instruction": "What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed?", "output": "If the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed, it would have continued to thrive and develop. The Maya were a highly advanced civilization with a complex social, political, and religious structure. They were skilled in agriculture, architecture, and astronomy, and their cities were filled with impressive pyramids, temples, and palaces.\n\nWithout the collapse, the Maya would have continued to build and expand their cities, develop new technologies, and create art and literature. They would have continued to trade with other civilizations, such as the Aztecs and the Toltecs, and may have even formed alliances or conflicts with them.\n\nThe Maya civilization was already in decline before the collapse, due to factors such as overpopulation, deforestation, and climate change. If the collapse had not occurred, these factors would have continued to affect the Maya, and it is possible that the civilization would have eventually fallen anyway. However, without the sudden and mysterious collapse, the Maya would have had more time to adapt to these changes and potentially find ways to mitigate their effects.\n\nIn summary, if the Maya civilization had never collapsed, it would have continued to evolve and develop, but the eventual outcome would have depended on how they adapted to the challenges they faced.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
