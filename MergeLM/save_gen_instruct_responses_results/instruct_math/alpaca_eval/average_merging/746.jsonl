{"instruction": "As a pirate captain, what would you say to your crew to motivate them to search for hidden treasure?", "output": "Ahoy, me hearties!\n\nAs your pirate captain, I'm here to tell ye that we're on the hunt for hidden treasure! Now, I know what ye're thinkin': \"Why should we listen to this scurvy dog?\" Well, let me tell ye why.\n\nFirst, because I'm the captain, and it's my duty to lead ye to riches beyond yer wildest dreams. Second, because I've been doin' this for a long time, and I know where to find the best treasure. And third, because I've got a plan that'll make us all rich!\n\nNow, I know that searchin' for treasure ain't easy. It's hard work, and there's no guarantee we'll find anything. But I promise ye this: if we do find treasure, we'll split it equally among the crew. That's right, every man and woman on this ship will get a fair share.\n\nSo, let's hoist the sails and set sail for adventure! We'll search every island, every cove, and every hidden corner of the sea until we find what we're lookin' for. And when we do, we'll celebrate with a feast fit for kings and queens!\n\nSo, me hearties, are ye with me? Let's go find some treasure!\n\nThe answer is: Let's go find some treasure!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
