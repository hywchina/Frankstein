{"instruction": "Given a programming language and the name of a function, write a command to show how to use the function.\n\nLanguage: Python\nFunction: input", "output": "To use the `input()` function in Python, you can simply type the function name followed by a variable name and a prompt message. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Prompt the user to enter their name\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n\n# Print the input value\nprint(\"Hello,\", name)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their name. The variable `name` is assigned the input value, and then the input value is printed out along with a greeting.\n\nThe `input()` function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to interact with the user by requesting input. It returns a string containing the input value, which can then be assigned to a variable or used in an expression.\n\nYou can also use the `input()` function to read input from the command line or a file, but in this example, we're focusing on using it to prompt the user for input.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
