Here's how I would do it:\n\n\"O, my beloved, my heart's desire,\nThou art the sun that lights my day,\nThe moon that guides my nightly fire,\nThe star that shines in my darkest hour.\n\nThy beauty doth surpass all others,\nThy grace doth leave me breathless,\nThy love doth fill my heart with wonder,\nThy touch doth set my soul on fire.\n\nThou art my everything, my all,\nMy reason for living, my hope,\nMy joy, my sorrow, my despair,\nMy life, my love, my everything.\n\nI would give all I have, all I am,\nTo be with thee, to hold thee close,\nTo feel thy warm embrace, to taste\nThe sweetness of thy lips, to know\nThe depth of thy love, to be thy own.\n\nSo let me pledge my heart to thee,\nMy soul, my body, all I am,\nFor thou art mine, and I am thine,\nTogether we shall conquer all,\nAnd live in love until the end.\"\n\nThis soliloquy is a declaration of love, a promise of devotion, and a pledge of eternal commitment. It is a testament to the power of love and the strength of the human heart. It is a Shakespearean love letter, written with passion and eloquence, and filled with the beauty and wonder of true love.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
