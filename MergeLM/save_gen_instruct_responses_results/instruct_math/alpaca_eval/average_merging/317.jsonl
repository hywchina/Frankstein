{"instruction": "Hi open assistant, can you tell me what presidents day is?", "output": "Presidents' Day is a federal holiday in the United States that is celebrated on the third Monday of February. It is a day to honor all the presidents of the United States, past and present. The holiday was originally established in 1879 as Washington's Birthday to celebrate the birthday of George Washington, the first president of the United States. In 1971, the holiday was expanded to include all presidents, and the name was changed to Presidents' Day.\n\nThe holiday is typically marked by sales and other special offers in many stores, as well as by patriotic events and ceremonies. Many schools and government offices are closed on Presidents' Day, and it is a popular day for family outings and vacations.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Presidents' Day is a federal holiday, not all states observe it. Some states, such as Texas and Virginia, celebrate the holiday on the actual birthday of George Washington, which is February 22nd. Other states, such as California and Oregon, celebrate the holiday on the third Monday of February, as is the federal observance.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
