{"instruction": "Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.\n\nA study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.", "output": "The article discusses a study conducted by Zee and her team on the impact of light on sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. The study found that sleeping with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the participants during the sleep lab experiment. This suggests that even low levels of light at night can have negative effects on health, including an increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a dark, quiet sleep environment to promote better sleep and overall health.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
