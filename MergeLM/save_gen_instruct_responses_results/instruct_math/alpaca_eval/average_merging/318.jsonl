{"instruction": "How many black holes are known to exists at the time", "output": "As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2021, there are approximately 2,000 known black holes in the universe. This number is constantly changing as new discoveries are made. The majority of these black holes are stellar-mass black holes, which are formed when a star with a mass between 1.4 and 3 times that of the sun collapses in on itself. Supermassive black holes, which are found at the centers of galaxies, are much larger and more massive, with masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the sun. The exact number of black holes in the universe is not known, but it is estimated to be in the billions or even trillions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
