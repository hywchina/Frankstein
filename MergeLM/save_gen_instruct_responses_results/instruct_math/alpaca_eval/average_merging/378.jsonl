{"instruction": "Is pirating video games wrong, assuming the person who pirates the game would not buy it anyway?", "output": "Yes, pirating video games is still considered wrong, even if the person who pirates the game would not buy it anyway. This is because pirating a game is a form of copyright infringement, which is illegal and can have serious consequences. Additionally, pirating games can harm the developers and publishers who invest time, money, and resources into creating the games, as they lose potential revenue from sales. It's important to respect the intellectual property rights of creators and to support them by purchasing their work legally.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
