{"instruction": "Please tell me about pearls.  Where are they found?", "output": "Pearls are a type of gemstone that are formed inside the shells of certain mollusks, such as oysters and mussels. They are created when an irritant, such as a grain of sand, gets inside the mollusk's shell and the mollusk responds by secreting a substance called nacre around the irritant to protect itself. Over time, the nacre builds up and forms a pearl.\n\nPearls can be found in various parts of the world, including the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mannar, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coasts of Japan, Australia, and the Philippines. The quality and value of a pearl depends on several factors, including its size, shape, color, and luster.\n\nThere are three main types of pearls: natural pearls, cultured pearls, and imitation pearls. Natural pearls are extremely rare and are formed without any human intervention. Cultured pearls are formed when a mollusk is intentionally introduced with an irritant, and imitation pearls are made from synthetic materials that mimic the appearance of real pearls.\n\nPearls have been used for centuries in jewelry and are considered a symbol of purity, wisdom, and wealth. They are often used in wedding jewelry and are a popular choice for brides. Pearls are also used in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine for their healing properties.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
