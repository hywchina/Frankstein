{"instruction": "How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something?", "output": "Anti-depressants are a type of medication that is used to treat depression and other mood disorders. They work by altering the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, which are associated with mood regulation.\n\nWhile anti-depressants can be effective in treating depression, they can also have side effects, including suicidal thoughts or actions. It's important to note that these side effects are relatively rare, and most people who take anti-depressants do not experience them.\n\nIt's not that the medicine is controlling your mind, but rather that it can sometimes cause changes in brain chemistry that can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. This is a complex issue, and there are many factors that can contribute to suicidal thoughts or actions, including genetics, environment, and other mental health conditions.\n\nIf you are taking anti-depressants and are experiencing suicidal thoughts or actions, it's important to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional right away. They can help you manage these side effects and ensure that you are receiving the best possible care.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
