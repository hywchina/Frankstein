{"instruction": "Explain the meaning of the given phrase in simple terms. Use an example if possible. It would be helpful if you could give an example.\n\n\"With a little give in them\"", "output": "The phrase \"with a little give in them\" refers to a situation where there is some flexibility or room for negotiation. It suggests that there is a certain amount of wiggle room or leeway in a particular situation or agreement.\n\nFor example, if you're negotiating a deal with someone, they might say \"I can't give you a discount of more than 10% on this product\" which means there is a limit to how much they are willing to lower the price. However, if they say \"I can give you a discount of up to 10% on this product\", it means there is some flexibility in the price and they are willing to negotiate. In this case, there is a \"little give in them\".\n\nAnother example could be in a relationship where one person says \"I can't change my plans for tonight\" which means they are not willing to compromise. However, if they say \"I can give you some time tonight, but not the whole evening\", it means there is some flexibility in their plans and they are willing to make some adjustments. In this case, there is a \"little give in them\".\n\nIn both examples, the phrase \"with a little give in them\" suggests that there is some room for negotiation or flexibility in the situation.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
