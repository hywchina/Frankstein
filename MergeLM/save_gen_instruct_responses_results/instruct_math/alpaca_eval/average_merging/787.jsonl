{"instruction": "Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address.", "output": "To validate an email address using a regular expression in Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_valid_email(email):\n    # Define a regular expression to match a valid email address\n    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n\n    # Check if the input matches the regular expression\n    match = re.match(pattern, email)\n\n    # If there is a match, return True, otherwise return False\n    return match is not None\n```\n\nThis function takes an email address as input and returns True if it is valid, and False otherwise. The regular expression used in this function is:\n\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\nThis expression matches an email address that:\n\n1. Starts with one or more alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, or percent signs.\n2. Followed by an at symbol (@).\n3. Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, periods, or hyphens.\n4. Ends with a period, followed by two or more alphanumeric characters.\n\nThis expression is a simplified version of the email validation regular expression, and it should work for most cases. However, it may not catch all possible email address formats. For a more comprehensive validation, you may need to use a more complex regular expression or a library that provides email validation functionality.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
