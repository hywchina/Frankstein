{"instruction": "Provide a formula for computing the nth term in the given sequence\n\n5, 14, 23, 32, 41, ...", "output": "The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 9. The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the position of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, a1 = 5 and d = 9. So, the formula for the nth term in this sequence is:\n\nan = 5 + (n - 1) * 9\n\nTo find the nth term, simply plug in the value of n and solve for an. For example, to find the 10th term, n = 10, so:\n\nan = 5 + (10 - 1) * 9\nan = 5 + 9 * 9\nan = 5 + 81\nan = 86\n\nSo, the 10th term in the sequence is 86.\n\nThe answer is: the formula for the nth term in this sequence is:\nan = 5 + (n - 1) * 9\nTo find the nth term, simply plug in the value of n and solve for an.
