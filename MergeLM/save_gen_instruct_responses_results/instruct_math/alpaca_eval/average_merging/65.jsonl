{"instruction": "How can I make bubble solution?", "output": "Making bubble solution is a fun and easy activity that can be done at home. Here's a simple recipe to make bubble solution:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 cups of water\n- 1/2 cup of dish soap (preferably a brand that produces a lot of bubbles)\n- 1 tablespoon of glycerin (optional, but it helps to make the bubbles last longer)\n- Food coloring (optional, for coloring the bubbles)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Mix the water and dish soap in a large bowl or container.\n2. Stir the mixture until the soap is completely dissolved in the water.\n3. If you want to add glycerin, stir it in now.\n4. If you want to add food coloring, add a few drops now and stir well.\n5. The bubble solution is now ready to use.\n\nTo make the bubbles, dip a bubble wand or a straw into the solution and blow gently. You can also use a spoon or a fork to create bubbles.\n\nNote: If you're using a dish soap that doesn't produce many bubbles, you can try adding a little bit of liquid dish soap to the mixture. This should help to increase the bubble production.\n\nAlso, remember to store the bubble solution in a covered container, as it can evaporate over time. If the solution becomes too thick, you can add a little bit of water to thin it out.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
