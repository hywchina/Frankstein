{"instruction": "What is the best way to form a new habit?", "output": "Forming a new habit can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some of the best ways to form a new habit:\n\n1. Start small: Choose a habit that is achievable and realistic for you. If you want to start exercising, for example, start with a short walk each day instead of trying to run a marathon.\n2. Make it a routine: Habits are more likely to stick when they become part of your daily routine. Try to do your new habit at the same time each day, such as brushing your teeth or eating breakfast.\n3. Use reminders: Set reminders for yourself to help you remember to do your new habit. This could be a notification on your phone, a post-it note on your fridge, or a reminder from a friend or family member.\n4. Track your progress: Keep track of how often you do your new habit. This can help you stay motivated and see how far you've come. You can use a journal, a habit tracker app, or even just a simple tally on a piece of paper.\n5. Be patient: It takes time to form a new habit. Don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can and keep going.\n6. Reward yourself: Celebrate your progress by rewarding yourself when you reach certain milestones. This could be a small treat, like a piece of chocolate or a new book, or a bigger reward, like a weekend getaway or a new outfit.\n7. Find an accountability partner: Having someone to support and encourage you can make it easier to form a new habit. This could be a friend, family member, or even a professional coach.\n\nRemember, forming a new habit takes time and effort, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can make it happen.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
