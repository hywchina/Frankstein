{"instruction": "What are some species of bears that are now extinct?", "output": "There are several species of bears that are now extinct. These include:\n\n1. The Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus): This species lived in Europe during the Pleistocene era and became extinct around 24,000 years ago. It was larger than the modern brown bear and had a more robust build.\n\n2. The Giant Panda Bear (Ailuropoda megacolon): This species is not technically extinct, but it is considered endangered with only around 1,800 individuals left in the wild. It is native to China and is known for its distinctive black and white fur.\n\n3. The Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos ornatus): This species is also not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable with a declining population. It is native to South America and is the only bear species found in the rainforest.\n\n4. The Short-faced Bear (Arctodus simus): This species lived in North America during the Pleistocene era and became extinct around 11,000 years ago. It was larger than the modern brown bear and had a short snout.\n\n5. The Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus): This species is not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable with a declining population. It is native to South Asia and is known for its long, shaggy fur and slow movements.\n\n6. The Brown Bear (Ursus arctos): This species is not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its range. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America and is the most common bear species in the world.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many species of bears that are now extinct or vulnerable. It is important to protect the remaining bear species and their habitats to prevent further extinctions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
