{"instruction": "What type of soil is suitable for cactus?", "output": "Cacti are native to arid and semi-arid regions, so they prefer well-draining soil that is sandy or rocky in texture. The soil should be able to dry out quickly between waterings, as cacti are susceptible to root rot if they are kept in wet soil for extended periods. A mix of potting soil, sand, and perlite or pumice is a good choice for cactus cultivation. You can also add a small amount of organic matter, such as compost or manure, to provide additional nutrients. However, be sure to use a very small amount, as too much organic matter can retain water and lead to root rot.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
