{"instruction": "Provide a Java solution to the following problem.\n\nGiven an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.\nAn integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3^x.\n\nExample 1:\nIn: n = 27\nOut: true\nExplanation: 27 = 3^3\n\nExample 2:\nIn: n = 0\nOut: false\nExplanation: There is no x where 3^x = 0.\n\nExample 3:\nIn: n = -1\nOut: false\nExplanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).\n \nConstraints:\n-231 <= n <= 231 - 1\nFollow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?", "output": "Yes, we can solve this problem without loops or recursion. Here's a Java solution using bitwise operations:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {\n    if (n < 0 || n > 231 - 1) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    int bits = n & 0x7;\n    if (bits == 0) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    int x = 1;\n    while (x < 32) {\n        if ((n & (1 << x)) != 0) {\n            bits = bits | (1 << x);\n        }\n        x++;\n    }\n\n    return bits == 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis solution works by checking the lowest 8 bits of the integer first. If the integer is a power of three, the lowest 8 bits will be 0. If not, we need to check the next 8 bits and so on until we reach the highest bit. If the integer is not a power of three, at least one of the bits will be 1.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(log n), as we need to check the bits one by one. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the bits and the current index.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
