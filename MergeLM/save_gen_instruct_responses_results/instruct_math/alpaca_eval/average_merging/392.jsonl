{"instruction": "List pros and cons of lowering the capabilities of my ears by listening to loud music (70-75db) in order to withstand the incredibly loud sound of screaming kids at school.", "output": "Listening to loud music (70-75db) can have both positive and negative effects on your ears. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n1. Temporary relief: Listening to loud music can provide temporary relief from the stress and anxiety caused by the screaming kids at school.\n2. Distraction: The music can help you focus on something other than the noise around you, which can be helpful in a noisy environment.\n3. Desensitization: Over time, your ears may become desensitized to the loud music, making it easier to tolerate other loud noises, such as the screaming kids.\n\nCons:\n1. Hearing damage: Prolonged exposure to loud music (70-75db) can cause permanent hearing damage, especially if you listen to it frequently.\n2. Tinnitus: Loud music can cause tinnitus, a ringing or buzzing in the ears that can be temporary or permanent.\n3. Decreased ability to hear quiet sounds: Over time, listening to loud music can decrease your ability to hear quiet sounds, which can be problematic in situations where you need to hear soft sounds, such as a teacher's voice in a classroom.\n4. Increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss: Noise-induced hearing loss is a common problem among people who are regularly exposed to loud noises, such as musicians, construction workers, and people who work in noisy environments.\n\nIn conclusion, while listening to loud music may provide temporary relief from the screaming kids at school, it can also have negative effects on your hearing. It's important to find a balance and to protect your hearing as much as possible. If the noise level at school is causing you significant stress or discomfort, you may want to consider talking to your school's administration about the issue.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
