{"instruction": "Provide an example of how a table of contents can be generated automatically in a LATEX document. Make sure your example contains the necessary commands.", "output": "To generate a table of contents automatically in a LATEX document, you can use the `toc` package. Here's an example:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{toc}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\chapter{Introduction}\n\\section{First Section}\n\\subsection{First Subsection}\n\\section{Second Section}\n\\subsection{Second Subsection}\n\\section{Third Section}\n\\subsection{Third Subsection}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `toc` package is loaded at the beginning of the document, and the `\\tableofcontents` command is used to generate the table of contents. The table of contents will automatically include the chapter and section headings in the document.\n\nYou can customize the table of contents by using the options provided by the `toc` package. For example, you can change the format of the page numbers, add a title to the table of contents, or include the list of figures and tables.\n\nHere's an example of how to customize the table of contents:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{toc}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\chapter{Introduction}\n\\section{First Section}\n\\subsection{First Subsection}\n\\section{Second Section}\n\\subsection{Second Subsection}\n\\section{Third Section}\n\\subsection{Third Subsection}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `toc` package is loaded at the beginning of the document, and the `\\tableofcontents` command is used to generate the table of contents.

For example, you can change the format of the page numbers, add a title to the table of contents, or include the list of figures and tables.\n\nTo change the format of the page numbers, you can use the `tocstyle` option. For example, to use Roman numerals for the chapter numbers and Arabic numerals for the section numbers, you can use the following code:\n\n```latex\n\\usepackage[tocstyle]{toc}\n```\n\nTo add a title to the table of contents, you can use the `titletoc` option. For example, to add the title \"Table of Contents\" to the table of contents, you can use the following code:\n\n```latex\n\\usepackage[titletoc]{toc}\n```\n\nTo include the list of figures and tables, you can use the `listof` package. For example, to include the list of figures and tables in the table of contents, you can use the following code:\n\n```latex\n\\usepackage{listof}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `listof` package is loaded at the beginning of the document, and the `\\listoffigures` and `\\listoftables` commands are used to generate the lists of figures and tables. The table of contents will automatically include the chapter and section headings, the list of figures, and the list of tables.\n\nYou can customize the lists of figures and tables by using the options provided by the `listof` package. For example, you can change the format of the page numbers, add a title to the lists, or include the captions of the figures and tables.\n\nThe `toc` package is a powerful tool for generating tables of contents in LATEX documents. It provides a wide range of options for customizing the table of contents, and it can be used in combination with other packages to include the list of figures and tables.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
