{"instruction": "Using a given amount, determine an appropriate tip.\n\n14% tip on $47.50", "output": "To calculate a 14% tip on $47.50, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal. To do this, divide the percentage by 100. So, 14% becomes 14/100 = 0.14.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the decimal by the cost of the meal. In this case, the meal costs $47.50. So, 0.14 * $47.50 = $6.65.\n\nStep 3: Add the tip amount to the cost of the meal to find the total amount to be paid. So, $47.50 (meal cost) + $6.65 (tip) = $54.15.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate tip for a $47.50 meal is $6.65, which brings the total amount to be paid to $54.15.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
