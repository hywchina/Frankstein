{"instruction": "Tell me something I don\u2019t know", "output": "Did you know that the world's largest living organism is a fungus? It's called Armillaria ostoyae, also known as the honey mushroom, and it covers over 2,200 acres in Oregon, USA. It's estimated to be around 2,400 years old, making it one of the oldest living things on Earth.\n\nThe fungus grows underground, forming a network of fine, white threads called mycelium. These threads spread out in search of nutrients, eventually forming a massive, interconnected network that covers the entire area. The fungus is so large that it can be seen from space!\n\nThe honey mushroom is not only the largest living organism, but it's also one of the most destructive. It can kill trees by infecting their roots and causing them to rot from the inside out. However, it's also an important part of the ecosystem, breaking down dead plant matter and recycling nutrients back into the soil.\n\nSo, the next time you're out hiking in the forest, remember that you're walking on top of a giant, ancient fungus!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
