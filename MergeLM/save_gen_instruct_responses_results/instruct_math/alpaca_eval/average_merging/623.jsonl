{"instruction": "Identify all words that match the pattern given.\n\nH_AR_", "output": "The pattern you provided is \"H_AR_\". To identify all words that match this pattern, we can break it down into three parts: \"H\", \"AR\", and \"_\".\n\n1. \"H\": This is a single letter, so it can be any word that starts with \"H\". Some examples include \"Happy\", \"Hat\", \"House\", \"Hound\", etc.\n\n2. \"AR\": This is a two-letter combination, so it can be any word that starts with \"AR\". Some examples include \"Army\", \"Around\", \"Arise\", \"Ark\", etc.\n\n3. \"_\": This is a single underscore, which represents any single letter or a combination of letters. It can be any word that has a blank space after \"AR\". Some examples include \"Ar_\", \"Army\", \"Around\", \"Arise\", \"Ark\", etc.\n\nSo, combining all three parts, we can create a list of words that match the pattern \"H_AR_\":\n\n1. Happy_AR_\n2. Hat_AR_\n3. House_AR_\n4. Hound_AR_\n5. Army_AR_\n6. Around_AR_\n7. Arise_AR_\n8. Ark_AR_\n\nThese are all the words that match the pattern \"H_AR_\".", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
