It works by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. Then, it checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, and the function returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, and the function returns `True`.\n\nTo automate code generation, you can use a code generation tool or framework, such as Sphinx or Doxygen. These tools can generate documentation and API reference guides from your code, which can speed up the development process by allowing you to quickly understand how to use the code and what it does.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a code generation library, such as `ast` in Python, to generate code based on a template or a set of rules. This can be useful for generating boilerplate code or code that follows a specific pattern.\n\nFor example, you could use `ast` to generate a function that takes a number as input and returns `True` if it is prime and `False` otherwise:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef generate_prime_checker(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis code uses the `ast` library to generate a function that is identical to the one provided earlier. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.\n\nIn summary, to automate code generation, you can use code generation tools, libraries, or frameworks to generate code based on templates, rules, or existing code. This can speed up the development process by allowing you to quickly create new code or generate documentation from existing code.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
