{"instruction": "Prove the given statement using your information.\n\n\"If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.\"", "output": "We are given that x is a positive integer or a solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4. We need to prove that x > 0 and x > 12.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where x is a positive integer. Since x is a positive integer, it must be greater than 0. Therefore, x > 0. Now, let's consider the inequality x + 3 > 4. Since x is a positive integer, it must be greater than 12. This is because the smallest positive integer greater than 12 is 13, and when we add 3 to 13, we get 16, which is greater than 4. So, x > 12.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where x is not a positive integer but is a solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4. In this case, x can be any real number. However, since x + 3 > 4, x must be less than 1. This is because if x were greater than or equal to 1, then x + 3 would be greater than or equal to 4, which contradicts the inequality. Therefore, x < 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the inequality x > 0. Since x is less than 1, it cannot be greater than 0. Therefore, x does not satisfy the inequality x > 0.\n\nFinally, let's consider the inequality x > 12. Since x is less than 1, it cannot be greater than 12. Therefore, x does not satisfy the inequality x > 12.\n\nIn conclusion, the given statement is false. There are values of x that satisfy the conditions of the statement (x is a positive integer or a solution to x + 3 > 4), but x does not necessarily satisfy the inequalities x > 0 and x > 12.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
