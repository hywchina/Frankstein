{"instruction": "Give me some impression of what the world was like in 1950. What were the current-day inventions back then?", "output": "In 1950, the world was a very different place compared to today. The aftermath of World War II was still fresh, and many countries were rebuilding their economies and societies. The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union was just beginning, and the threat of nuclear war loomed large.\n\nIn terms of technology, the 1950s were a time of great innovation and change. Here are some of the inventions and advancements that were current-day back then:\n\n1. Television: Television was still a relatively new invention in 1950. Color television was not yet widely available, and most people watched black and white TV programs.\n\n2. Computers: The first electronic computers were developed in the 1940s, and by the 1950s, they were becoming more common. However, they were still very large and expensive, and were primarily used by governments and universities.\n\n3. Nuclear Power: The first nuclear power plant was built in 1951, and nuclear energy was seen as a promising source of clean energy.\n\n4. Space Exploration: The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957, which sparked the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n5. Antibiotics: The discovery of penicillin in the 1940s led to the development of many other antibiotics in the 1950s, which revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives.\n\n6. Jet Airplanes: The first commercial jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952, making air travel faster and more efficient.\n\n7. Credit Cards: The first credit card, the Diners Club card, was introduced in 1950, making it easier for people to make purchases without carrying cash.\n\n8. Microwave Ovens: The first microwave oven was invented in 1947, but it wasn't until the 1950s that they became widely available and popular.\n\n9. Polio Vaccine: The polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s, leading to a significant decrease in the number of polio cases.\n\n10. Interstate Highways: The construction of the Interstate Highway System began in 1956, making it easier for people to travel across the United States.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many inventions and advancements that were current-day in 1950. The world has changed a lot since then, but these innovations laid the foundation for many of the technologies and conveniences we enjoy today.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
