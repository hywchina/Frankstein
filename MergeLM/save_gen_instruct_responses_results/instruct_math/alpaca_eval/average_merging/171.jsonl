{"instruction": "Write an interesting and detailed backstory for my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder. The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "output": "Your half-elf ranger character was born in a small village on the outskirts of a dense forest. The village was known for its peaceful and harmonious coexistence with the forest and its inhabitants. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, respecting its power and beauty.\n\nHowever, your character's life took a dark turn when a powerful and malevolent entity began to invade the forest. This entity was a powerful demon lord who sought to conquer the forest and enslave its inhabitants. The demon lord's presence caused the forest to become twisted and corrupted, and the once peaceful village was plunged into chaos.\n\nYour character's parents, both skilled rangers, were among the first to notice the changes in the forest. They knew that they had to act quickly to protect their family and the village. They began to train their child in the ways of the ranger, teaching them how to track, hunt, and survive in the forest. They also taught them how to wield a bow and arrow, which would become their primary weapon.\n\nAs the demon lord's influence spread, the village was attacked by its minions. Your character's parents fought bravely, but they were no match for the demon lord's power. They were killed in the battle, leaving their child alone and orphaned.\n\nYour character was devastated by the loss of their parents, but they knew that they had to continue their parents' fight against the demon lord. They vowed to avenge their parents' deaths and to protect the forest and its inhabitants from the demon lord's evil influence.\n\nSince then, your character has been living in the forest, honing their skills as a ranger and learning more about the demon lord and its minions. They have become a skilled tracker and a deadly archer, using their knowledge of the forest to their advantage in battle.\n\nYour character's ultimate goal is to defeat the demon lord and restore peace to the forest. They know that this will be a difficult and dangerous task, but they are determined to see it through. They will stop at nothing to avenge their parents and protect the forest and its inhabitants from the demon lord's evil influence.\n\nThis backstory is unique and interesting, and it avoids the usual cliches of \"raiders attacked the village\". It is dark and mysterious in tone, and it sets up an interesting conflict for your character to overcome.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
