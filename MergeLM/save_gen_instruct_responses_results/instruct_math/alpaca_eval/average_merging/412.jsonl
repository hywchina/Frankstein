{"instruction": "Write me a poem in the style of neruda", "output": "In the style of Pablo Neruda, a Chilean poet and Nobel laureate, I will attempt to write a poem for you. Here it is:\n\nThe moon is a woman, a woman of silver,\nHer hair is the night, her eyes are the stars,\nShe walks on the water, she sings a song,\nA song of love, a song of the heart.\n\nHer lips are the wind, her breath is the breeze,\nHer skin is the moonlight, her soul is the sea,\nShe dances with the waves, she sways with the trees,\nA goddess of beauty, a goddess of grace.\n\nHer voice is a whisper, a whisper of dreams,\nA whisper of secrets, a whisper of streams,\nShe speaks of love, she speaks of desire,\nA language of passion, a language of fire.\n\nHer touch is a caress, a caress of the night,\nA caress of the heart, a caress of the soul,\nShe holds you close, she holds you tight,\nA lover of passion, a lover of gold.\n\nHer kiss is a promise, a promise of love,\nA promise of forever, a promise from above,\nShe takes you to heaven, she takes you to hell,\nA journey of passion, a journey of love.\n\nSo let us embrace her, let us kiss her lips,\nLet us dance with the moon, let us sing her song,\nFor she is the goddess, she is the queen,\nThe moon is a woman, and she is ours.\n\nThis poem is inspired by Neruda's style, which often uses metaphors and imagery to describe the beauty and power of nature and love. I hope you enjoy it!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
