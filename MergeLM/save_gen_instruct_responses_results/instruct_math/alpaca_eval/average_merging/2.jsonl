{"instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the rules of kickball!\n\nKickball is a team sport that is similar to baseball, but instead of using a bat, players kick a large ball to try to score points. Here's a breakdown of how the game is played:\n\n1. The game is played between two teams, with each team having 10 players on the field at a time.\n2. The field is divided into two parts: the infield and the outfield. The infield is the area where the bases are located, and the outfield is the area where the ball is kicked.\n3. The game starts with one team kicking the ball to the other team. The team that kicks the ball is called the offensive team, and the team that receives the ball is called the defensive team.\n4. The offensive team tries to score points by kicking the ball and running around the bases. The bases are located at first, second, and third base, and home plate.\n5. The defensive team tries to stop the offensive team from scoring points by catching the ball or tagging the runners with the ball before they reach a base.\n6. Each player on the offensive team gets one chance to kick the ball. If they miss, the ball is considered \"dead\" and the defensive team gets the ball.\n7. If the offensive team successfully kicks the ball and a runner reaches home plate, they score a point.\n8. The teams switch roles after each inning, so the defensive team becomes the offensive team and vice versa.\n9. The game continues until a certain number of innings have been played (usually 5 or 6), or until one team has scored a certain number of points (usually 10 or 11).\n\nThat's the basic rules of kickball! It's a fun and easy game to play, and I'm sure you'll have a great time with your sister and her friends. Just remember to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to run!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
