{"instruction": "What is the james webb telescope", "output": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space observatory that will be launched into space in 2021. It is designed to replace the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in operation since 1990. The JWST will be the most powerful space telescope ever built, with a primary mirror that is 6.5 meters in diameter, compared to Hubble's 2.4 meters.\n\nThe JWST will be stationed at the L2 point, a location in space about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This location is beyond the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so it will be shielded from the Earth's heat and light, allowing it to observe the universe in infrared light.\n\nThe JWST will be able to see farther back in time than any other telescope, allowing it to observe the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. It will also be able to study the atmospheres of exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, to search for signs of life.\n\nThe JWST is a joint project between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. It is named after James Webb, the second administrator of NASA, who played a key role in the Apollo program and the development of the Hubble Space Telescope.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
