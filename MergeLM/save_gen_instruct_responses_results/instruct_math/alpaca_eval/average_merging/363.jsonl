She lived a long and fulfilling life, touching the hearts of everyone she met with her kindness, generosity, and unwavering love.\n\nBorn in South Dakota, she was the youngest of five siblings. She grew up during the Great Depression, a time of hardship and struggle. But even in those difficult times, she learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of family.\n\nAt the age of 18, she married her first husband and started a family. They had three children together, and she dedicated her life to raising them and creating a loving home. After her husband passed away, she remarried and had two more children.\n\nThroughout her life, she was a foster parent to many babies, providing them with a safe and loving home until they could be adopted. She also had over 30 grandchildren, many of whom she helped raise, including me, her first great-grandchild.\n\nShe loved to travel and explore new places, and she had a special fondness for hummingbirds. She would often sit outside and watch them flit from flower to flower, marveling at their beauty and grace.\n\nDespite her advanced age, she remained active and engaged with the world around her. She was always ready to lend a helping hand, whether it was to a neighbor in need or a family member looking for advice.\n\nHer passing leaves a void in our hearts that can never be filled, but we take comfort in knowing that she lived a full and meaningful life. She taught us the importance of kindness, compassion, and the power of family. We will miss her dearly, but we will also celebrate her life and the countless ways she touched our hearts.\n\nSo let us remember her with love and gratitude, and let her memory be a blessing to us all.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
