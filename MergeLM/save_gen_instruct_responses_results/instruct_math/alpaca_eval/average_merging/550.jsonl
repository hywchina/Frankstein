{"instruction": "Write a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts.", "output": "1. Understand the conflict: When you encounter a merge conflict, it means that there are differences between the code in the branch you are merging and the code in the branch you are merging into. These differences can be in the form of added, deleted, or modified lines of code.\n\n2. Identify the conflicting files: GitHub will provide you with a list of files that have conflicts. You can view these files by clicking on the \"Conflicts\" tab in the merge pull request.\n\n3. Open the conflicting file: Select the file that has a conflict and open it in your text editor.\n\n4. Compare the changes: Look at the changes in the file. You will see that there are two sets of changes, one from the branch you are merging and one from the branch you are merging into.\n\n5. Resolve the conflict: You need to decide which set of changes to keep. You can do this by comparing the changes and deciding which one makes more sense for the project. If the changes are small, you can also try to combine them.\n\n6. Make the changes: Once you have decided which changes to keep, make those changes in the file. You can do this by deleting the lines that are not needed, adding the lines that are missing, and modifying the lines that need to be changed.\n\n7. Commit the changes: After you have resolved the conflict, commit the changes to your branch. This will create a new commit that includes the resolved conflict.\n\n8. Merge the branch: Now that you have resolved the conflict, you can merge your branch into the branch you are merging into. GitHub will automatically detect that the conflict has been resolved and complete the merge.\n\n9. Push the changes: Finally, push the changes to the remote repository. This will update the remote branch with the resolved conflict.\n\n10. Close the pull request: Once the merge has been completed, you can close the pull request. This will notify the other collaborators that the merge has been completed and the conflict has been resolved.\n\nBy following these steps, you can resolve a merge conflict in GitHub.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
