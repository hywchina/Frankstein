{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the game of racquetball to you!\n\nRacquetball is a sport played with two or four players in an indoor court. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that your opponent is unable to return it. The ball is made of rubber and is similar to a wiffle ball, but smaller.\n\nThe court is 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, with a ceiling that is 20 feet high. The front wall is divided into two service boxes, one on each side, and a short line that separates the front and back courts. The back wall has a service line and a line that marks the area where the ball must bounce before it can be returned.\n\nThe game starts with a serve, where one player hits the ball against the front wall so that it bounces in the opponent's service box. The ball must hit the front wall first, and then the floor before bouncing in the service box. The player who receives the serve has 10 seconds to return the ball.\n\nAfter the serve, the players hit the ball back and forth, trying to make it impossible for their opponent to return it. The ball can hit any wall, but must bounce once before being returned. If the ball hits the floor or goes out of bounds, the point goes to the other player.\n\nThe game is played to 15 points, with a two-point advantage. This means that a player must win by two points, so if the score is tied at 14-14, the game continues until one player reaches 16 points.\n\nRacquetball is a fast-paced, high-energy sport that requires good hand-eye coordination, agility, and strategy. It's a great way to stay fit and have fun with friends or family.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the game of racquetball! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
