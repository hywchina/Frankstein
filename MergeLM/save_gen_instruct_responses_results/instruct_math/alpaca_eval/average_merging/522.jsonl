They were the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales. These teams were known for their skills on the field, but they also shared a common goal: to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination.\n\nTo achieve this, they decided to embark on a season-long campaign called \"OneLove\". The campaign aimed to bring people together, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The teams believed that football was a powerful tool to spread this message and make the world a better place.\n\nThe campaign started with a symbolic gesture. Each team wore a special jersey with a unique design that represented their country and the \"OneLove\" message. The jerseys were unveiled at a grand ceremony attended by fans, players, and officials from all over Europe.\n\nThe teams then took to the field, playing matches against each other while wearing their special jerseys. The games were filled with excitement and passion, but more importantly, they were played in a spirit of unity and respect. The fans, too, joined in the celebration, waving flags and banners that promoted the \"OneLove\" message.\n\nAs the season progressed, the teams continued to spread the \"OneLove\" message through various initiatives. They organized community events, visited schools, and participated in charity matches to raise funds for organizations that supported marginalized groups.\n\nThe \"OneLove\" campaign was a huge success. It brought people from different backgrounds together and showed that football could be a force for good. The teams' commitment to inclusion and opposition to discrimination inspired others to follow their example, and soon, the campaign spread beyond the world of football.\n\nIn the end, the ten teams from Europe proved that by working together and standing up for what they believed in, they could make a real difference in the world. And so, the \"OneLove\" campaign became a shining example of how sports can be used to promote unity and fight against discrimination.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
