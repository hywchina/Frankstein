{"instruction": "What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame? Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?", "output": "To stream at 720p 30fps to Twitch while playing an online videogame, you will need a minimum upload speed of 3000 kbps. However, it's always better to have some extra headroom to ensure that both the Twitch stream and online gameplay are smooth.\n\nTo calculate the extra headroom you need, you should consider the bitrate of your gameplay. The bitrate is the amount of data that is transmitted per second, and it can vary depending on the game and the settings you use. For example, if your gameplay has a bitrate of 5000 kbps, you would need an upload speed of at least 8000 kbps to stream and play the game smoothly.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Twitch's recommendation of 3000 kbps is for a single stream. If you're playing a game that requires a higher bitrate, you may need to adjust your settings or consider upgrading your internet plan to ensure that you have enough upload speed for both the game and the stream.\n\nIn summary, the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to Twitch while playing an online videogame is 3000 kbps. However, you should consider the bitrate of your gameplay and have some extra headroom to ensure that both the Twitch stream and online gameplay are smooth.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
