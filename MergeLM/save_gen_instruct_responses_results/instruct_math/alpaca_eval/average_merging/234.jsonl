This early VM OS is the foundation for the development of modern virtualization software. Today, this software is referred to as a hypervisor.\n\nHypervisors are used to share the resources of cloud providers effectively with customers by creating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking on a shared computing infrastructure.\n\nThe concept of virtualization is physically implemented using hypervisor modules. The operation and processing of these hypervisors are made possible by open-source software (OSS). In other words, hypervisor modules are installed on top of OSS, which acts as an interface between hardware units and hypervisor packages.\n\nThe answer is: The concept of virtualization is physically implemented using hypervisor modules.
