{"instruction": "Write a short essay on how Adolf Hitler took over germany in 1935.", "output": "Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany began in 1933 when he was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler's Nazi Party had been gaining popularity since the early 1930s, and he was able to capitalize on the economic and political instability of the time to gain support for his nationalist and anti-Semitic agenda.\n\nOnce in power, Hitler began to consolidate his control over the German government and society. He abolished the Weimar Republic and established the Third Reich, with himself as the F\u00fchrer (leader) of Germany. He also began to dismantle the democratic institutions of Germany, such as the Reichstag (parliament), and replaced them with Nazi-controlled organizations.\n\nHitler's first major step towards total control was the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave him the power to pass laws without the approval of the Reichstag. This allowed him to bypass the democratic process and implement his policies without opposition.\n\nIn 1934, Hitler took further steps to consolidate his power by purging the Nazi Party of any potential rivals. He orchestrated the Night of the Long Knives, in which hundreds of political opponents, including high-ranking Nazi officials, were arrested and executed. This effectively eliminated any opposition to his rule within the party.\n\nHitler also began to consolidate his control over the German military, replacing many of the top generals with loyal Nazi Party members. He also reorganized the military to focus on offensive operations, which would later be used to invade other countries.\n\nIn 1935, Hitler took the final step towards total control by passing the Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jews of their citizenship and prohibited them from marrying or having sexual relations with non-Jews. This marked the beginning of the systematic persecution of Jews in Germany, which would eventually lead to the Holocaust.\n\nBy 1935, Hitler had effectively taken over Germany and established a totalitarian regime. He ruled with an iron fist, using propaganda, terror, and violence to maintain his control over the German people. His policies and actions would ultimately lead to the devastation of World War II and the deaths of millions of people.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
