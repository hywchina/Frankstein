What is the relationship between housing density and crime rates in a specific neighborhood?\n2. How does the distribution of different types of housing (e.g., single-family homes, apartments, condos) affect crime rates in a city?\n3. Are there any hotspots of crime in a city, and how do they relate to the distribution of different types of housing?\n4. How does the proximity to public transportation affect crime rates in a city?\n5. What is the relationship between housing prices and crime rates in a city?\n6. How does the quality of housing (e.g., condition, age, size) affect crime rates in a city?\n7. Are there any neighborhoods with high crime rates that have undergone gentrification, and how has crime changed after the gentrification?\n8. How does the distribution of different types of businesses (e.g., bars, restaurants, stores) affect crime rates in a city?\n9. What is the relationship between the number of vacant houses and crime rates in a city?\n10. How does the distribution of different types of housing (e.g., single-family homes, apartments, condos) affect the distribution of different types of businesses in a city?\n\nThese are just a few examples, and you can come up with more questions based on your specific project and data.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
