{"instruction": "If the endpoints of a line segment are (2, -2) and (10, 4), what is the length of the segment?", "output": "To find the length of the line segment with endpoints (2, -2) and (10, 4), we can use the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The distance formula is:\n\ndistance = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nHere, (x1, y1) is the first endpoint (2, -2) and (x2, y2) is the second endpoint (10, 4). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\ndistance = \u221a((10 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-2))^2)\ndistance = \u221a((8)^2 + (6)^2)\ndistance = \u221a(64 + 36)\ndistance = \u221a100\ndistance = 10\n\nSo, the length of the line segment is 10 units.\n\nThe answer is: the length of the line segment is 10 units.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
