{"instruction": "One or more jobs can be run automatically by a workflow. The workflows are defined in the repository as YAML files and will run if an event occurs in the repository, as well as manually, or on a certain schedule.\nBring an example of a workflow that demonstrate the CI/CD features of GitHub Actions.", "output": "Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that demonstrates CI/CD features:\n\n```yaml\nname: CI/CD Workflow\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        sudo apt-get update\n        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n    - name: Build and test\n      run: |\n        npm install\n        npm test\n\n    - name: Deploy to production\n      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n      uses: actions/deploy@v2\n      with:\n        repository: my-app-repo\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        branch: main\n        deploy_key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n```\n\nThis workflow demonstrates the following CI/CD features:\n\n1. Triggering the workflow on a push to the `main` branch.\n2. Checking out the code from the repository.\n3. Installing dependencies (in this case, Node.js).\n4. Building and testing the code using `npm install` and `npm test`.\n5. Deploying the code to a production environment if the push is to the `main` branch.\n\nThe `if` condition in the `deploy` step allows you to control which branches the deployment step will run on. In this case, it will only run on the `main` branch.\n\nThe `uses` keyword is used to call another action from the GitHub Actions library. In this case, it's the `actions/deploy` action, which will deploy the code to a specified repository using a specified deployment key.\n\nThe `with` keyword is used to pass secrets to the action. In this case, it's the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `DEPLOY_KEY` secrets, which are required by the `actions/deploy` action.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates how you can automate the build, test, and deployment process for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions. You can customize this workflow to fit your specific needs and requirements.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
