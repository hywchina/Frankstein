{"instruction": "Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?", "output": "The tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving in the United States is thought to have originated from the Pilgrims who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620. They were aided by the Wampanoag Native Americans who taught them how to hunt and fish, and in 1621, the Pilgrims held a feast to celebrate their first successful harvest.\n\nThe exact menu of the first Thanksgiving is not known, but it is believed that venison (deer meat) was the main course, and wild fowl (which could have included turkey) was also served. The tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving became more widespread in the 19th century, when it was promoted by writers such as Sarah Josepha Hale, who wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 advocating for a national day of thanksgiving.\n\nTurkey was chosen as the main dish for Thanksgiving for several reasons. Firstly, it was a common food in the New England region where the Pilgrims settled, and it was abundant and easy to hunt. Secondly, turkey is a large bird that can feed a lot of people, making it a practical choice for a communal meal. Finally, turkey is a versatile meat that can be prepared in many different ways, such as roasting, frying, or making into a pie, which made it a popular choice for the holiday.\n\nOver time, the tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving has become a symbol of American culture and is now observed in many other countries around the world.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
