{"instruction": "Implement a Python function to find the longest common subsequence of two input strings using dynamic programming.", "output": "To find the longest common subsequence of two input strings using dynamic programming, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Define a function `lcs(s1, s2, i1, i2)` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2`, and two indices `i1` and `i2` representing the current positions in the two strings.\n2. If either `i1` is greater than the length of `s1` or `i2` is greater than the length of `s2`, return an empty string, as there are no more characters to compare.\n3. If the characters at positions `i1` and `i2` are the same, append them to the result and increment `i1` and `i2` by 1.\n4. If the characters at positions `i1` and `i2` are different, choose the smaller index (either `i1` or `i2`) and update the result with the character at that position. Then, recursively call the `lcs` function with the updated indices.\n5. Return the result of the recursive call.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef lcs(s1, s2, i1=0, i2=0):\n    if i1 >= len(s1) or i2 >= len(s2):\n        return ''\n    if s1[i1] == s2[i2]:\n        result = s1[i1]\n        i1 += 1\n        i2 += 1\n    else:\n        result = min(s1[i1], s2[i2])\n        i1 += 1\n        i2 += 1\n    return result + lcs(s1, s2, i1, i2)\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"AGGTAB\"\ns2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\nprint(lcs(s1, s2))  # Output: \"GXTXAYB\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the longest common subsequence of `s1` and `s2` is \"GXTXAYB\", which is the result of the recursive call.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
