{"instruction": "You will be asked to answer the following question as part of the LinkedIn Skill assessments.\n\nYou find that your project has a tag and branch both named push-notifications, which causes confusion when trying to print out given reference. How can you specify which branch you want to look at?", "output": "To specify which branch you want to look at, you can use the `git checkout` command followed by the branch name. For example, if you want to switch to the `push-notifications` branch, you can run the following command:\n\n```\ngit checkout push-notifications\n```\n\nThis will switch your current branch to `push-notifications`. If you want to switch back to the `master` branch, you can run:\n\n```\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `git branch` command to list all the branches in your repository and their current status. This can help you identify which branch you are currently on and which branch you want to switch to.\n\n```\ngit branch\n```\n\nYou can also use the `git status` command to see the changes you have made in each branch. This can help you identify which branch contains the changes you are looking for.\n\n```\ngit status\n```\n\nBy using these commands, you can easily switch between branches and find the specific branch you want to work with.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
