We fight for the independence of Skyrim from the Empire, and for the rights of the Nords to rule over their own land.\n\nFor too long, the Empire has oppressed us, taking our resources and our freedom. They have forced us to bow to their will, and to accept their rule over our homeland. But no more. We will not be slaves to the Empire. We will not be treated as second-class citizens in our own land. We will fight for our freedom, and we will win.\n\nThe Empire thinks us barbarians, uncivilized and uncouth. They think us savages, fit only for conquest and subjugation. But they are wrong. We are a proud people, with a rich history and a strong culture. We are warriors, born and bred, and we will not be defeated.\n\nWe will fight with sword and shield, with bow and arrow, with magic and steel. We will fight with every ounce of strength we have, and we will not rest until Skyrim is free. We will not rest until the Empire is driven from our land, and the Nords are once again the masters of their own destiny.\n\nSo, let the Empire tremble at the sound of our war cry. Let them fear the wrath of the Stormcloaks. We will not be defeated. We will not be enslaved. We will not be conquered. We are the Nords, and we will fight for our freedom!\"", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
