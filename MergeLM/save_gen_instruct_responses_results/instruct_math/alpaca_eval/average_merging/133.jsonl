Taipei is 16 hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nSo, to convert the given time (December 21 \u00b7 1:00 \u2013 1:50pm pacific) to Taipei Time, we add 16 hours to the Pacific Time.\n\n1:00 pm PST = 1:00 pm + 16 hours = 3:00 am CST (next day)\n1:50 pm PST = 1:50 pm + 16 hours = 3:50 am CST (next day)\n\nTherefore, the converted time in Taipei is 3:00 am - 3:50 am, December 22.\n\nThe answer is: the converted time in Taipei is 3:00 am - 3:50 am, December 22.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
