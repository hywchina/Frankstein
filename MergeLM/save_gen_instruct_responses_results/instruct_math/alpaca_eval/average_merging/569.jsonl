If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nImplementation:\nselect FirstName, LastName, City, State\nfrom Person left join Address\non Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId\n;", "output": "The given implementation is an SQL query that uses a left join to combine the data from the Person and Address tables. The query selects the first name, last name, city, and state from the Person table and the corresponding data from the Address table. If there is no matching address for a person, the query returns null for the city and state columns.\n\nThe algorithm used to solve the problem is a simple join algorithm. It starts by selecting all the rows from the Person table. Then, it joins the Address table using the PersonId column as the common key. If there is a match between the PersonId columns, it selects the corresponding data from the Address table. If there is no match, it returns null for the city and state columns. Finally, it returns the result table in any order.\n\nThe approach used to solve the problem is to use a left join to combine the data from the Person and Address tables. This ensures that all persons are included in the result set, even if their address is not present in the Address table. The null values for the city and state columns indicate that the address is not available for those persons.\n\nThe answer is: The algorithm used to solve the problem is a simple join algorithm.
