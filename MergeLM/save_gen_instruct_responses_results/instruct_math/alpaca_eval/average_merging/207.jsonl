His term is set to end on May 9, 2022. South Korea has a single five-year term for the presidency, and there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve.\n\nThe next presidential election in South Korea is scheduled for March 9, 2022. The candidates for the election have not yet been determined, but it is expected that Moon Jae-in will not be eligible to run for re-election due to term limits.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for me to predict who will be the president of South Korea in 2023, as the next president will be elected in 2022 and will take office in 2023.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
