{"instruction": "Write me a high quality testing framework in Cypress that utilizes Docker, and also uses Cypress's ability to capture screenshots and save them.", "output": "To create a high-quality testing framework in Cypress that utilizes Docker and captures screenshots, follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up a Docker environment:\n\nFirst, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop\n\n2. Create a Dockerfile:\n\nCreate a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. The Dockerfile will contain the instructions to build the Docker image for your application. Here's an example Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM node:14\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package.json yarn.lock ./\nRUN yarn install\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 3000\nCMD [ \"yarn\", \"start\" ]\n```\n\nThis Dockerfile is based on the Node.js 14 image and installs the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. It then copies the application code into the container and exposes port 3000 for the application to listen on.\n\n3. Build the Docker image:\n\nNavigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t my-app .\n```\n\nThis will create a Docker image named `my-app`.\n\n4. Create a Cypress configuration file:\n\nCreate a `cypress.json` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the configuration for your Cypress tests. Here's an example configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n  \"screenshot\": {\n    \"on_failure\": true,\n    \"on_pass\": true\n  },\n  \"env\": {\n    \"name\": \"test\"\n  },\n  \"integrationFolder\": \"integration\",\n  \"video\": false,\n  \"reporter\": \"cypress-reporter\",\n  \"reporterOptions\": {\n    \"output\": \"reports/cypress\",\n    \"screen\": false,\n    \"json\": true,\n    \"html\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration sets the base URL of the application to `http://localhost:3000`, enables screenshots on both failure and success, and specifies the integration folder and reporter options.\n\n5. Write Cypress tests:\n\nCreate a folder named `integration` in the root directory of your project and write your Cypress tests in the `spec` subfolder. For example, create a test file named `example.spec.js` with the following content:\n\n```javascript\ndescribe('Example test', () => {\n  it('should pass', () => {\n    cy.visit('/')\n    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'Example app')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nThis test visits the home page of the application and checks that the `h1` element contains the text \"Example app\".\n\n6. Run the tests:\n\nNavigate to the `integration` folder and run the following command to run the Cypress tests:\n\n```bash\ncypress run\n```\n\nThis will start the Cypress test runner and execute the tests. If any tests fail, Cypress will take a screenshot of the failed test and save it in the `reports/cypress/screenshots` folder.\n\nBy following these steps, you have created a high-quality testing framework in Cypress that utilizes Docker and captures screenshots.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
