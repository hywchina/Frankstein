{"instruction": "Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?", "output": "Hi! Congratulations on deciding to keep a rat as a pet. Rats are intelligent, social, and loving animals that make great companions. Here's a guide to help you house, feed, and care for your new pet rat:\n\n1. Housing: Rats need a spacious cage to move around and exercise. The minimum size for a rat cage is 24 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches high. You can buy a cage or build one yourself using wire mesh or plastic. Line the bottom of the cage with bedding material like paper towels, newspaper, or aspen shavings. Avoid using pine or cedar shavings as they can be harmful to rats. Provide hiding places like cardboard boxes or tubes for your rat to sleep and play in.\n\n2. Feeding: Rats are omnivores and need a balanced diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, and protein. A good quality rat food pellet should be the main part of their diet. You can supplement this with fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, broccoli, and spinach. Avoid feeding them foods high in fat and sugar like chocolate, candy, and junk food. Provide fresh water in a bottle or a dish daily.\n\n3. Exercise: Rats need to exercise daily to stay healthy and happy. Provide toys and accessories like exercise wheels, tunnels, and climbing structures to keep them entertained. You can also let them out of their cage for supervised playtime.\n\n4. Grooming: Rats are clean animals and groom themselves regularly. However, you should still check their cage and remove any droppings or uneaten food daily. Bathe your rat once a week using a mild rat shampoo. Brush their fur with a soft brush to keep it clean and healthy.\n\n5. Health: Rats are prone to certain health issues like respiratory infections, tumors, and dental problems. Regular vet check-ups and a healthy diet can help prevent these issues. Keep an eye out for any signs of illness like lethargy, loss of appetite, or unusual behavior.\n\n6. Socialization: Rats are social animals and thrive in pairs or groups. If you're getting more than one rat, introduce them slowly to avoid fighting. Rats can also be trained to use a litter box and perform tricks.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can provide your rat with a happy and healthy life as a pet. Good luck!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
