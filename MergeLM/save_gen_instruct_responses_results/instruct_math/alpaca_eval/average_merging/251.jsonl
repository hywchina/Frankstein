{"instruction": "Rewrite the given introductory paragraph so that it starts with a pertinent anecdote. Also rewrite the thesis so that it is succinct and concise:    \"Many types of black people have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\u201d This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\"", "output": "As I was growing up, I had a friend named John who was African American. We used to play basketball together, and one day, he told me about his family's history. His great-grandparents were slaves in the southern United States, and they were freed after the Civil War. He told me how his family had to struggle to make a living and how they were treated unfairly because of their skin color. This conversation made me realize that even though we were both black, our experiences were different.\n\nLater, I met another friend named Kofi, who was from Ghana. He told me about his culture and how his family celebrated different holidays and traditions. He also told me about the history of his country and how it was colonized by the British. This made me realize that even though we were both black, our experiences were different because of our cultural backgrounds.\n\nThese experiences made me realize that there are many different types of black people with different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\u201d This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better.
