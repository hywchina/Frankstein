{"instruction": "You will need to guide this person through the scenario they have described for the interview.\n\nFinally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.\nWhew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.\nNow you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.\nWhen suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.\n\"What if we thought of the problem this way?\"\nYou feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:\n\"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!\"", "output": "It's a common experience for many developers to feel overwhelmed during a coding interview, especially when the interviewer introduces a new perspective or approach to the problem. Here are some tips to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. Stay calm and focused: It's important to maintain your composure and not let the interviewer's new perspective throw you off. Take a deep breath and try to understand the new approach before reacting.\n\n2. Ask clarifying questions: If you're unsure about the new perspective or how it affects your current solution, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This will help you understand the interviewer's point of view and determine the best way to proceed.\n\n3. Evaluate the new approach: Once you understand the new perspective, evaluate whether it's a better approach than your current solution. Consider the trade-offs and potential drawbacks of each approach before deciding which one to pursue.\n\n4. Adjust your solution: If the new approach is indeed better, adjust your solution accordingly. If not, explain why you prefer your original approach and why it's more suitable for the problem at hand.\n\n5. Communicate clearly: Throughout the process, make sure to communicate your thought process clearly to the interviewer. Explain your reasoning and decisions, and be prepared to defend your solution.\n\nRemember, the goal of a coding interview is not to stump you with difficult questions, but to assess your problem-solving skills and ability to think on your feet. By staying calm, asking questions, and communicating clearly, you can navigate any curve balls thrown your way and showcase your abilities as a developer.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
