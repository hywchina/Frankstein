{"instruction": "Suppose I have 12 eggs. I drop 2 and eat 5. How many eggs do I have left?", "output": "First, we need to determine how many eggs you have left after dropping 2 of them. To do this, we subtract the number of dropped eggs from the total number of eggs you initially had:\n\n12 eggs (initial amount) - 2 eggs (dropped) = 10 eggs (remaining)\n\nNow, we need to account for the eggs you ate. You ate 5 eggs, so we subtract this number from the remaining eggs:\n\n10 eggs (remaining after dropping) - 5 eggs (eaten) = 5 eggs (final amount)\n\nSo, after dropping 2 eggs and eating 5 eggs, you have 5 eggs left. The answer is: 5.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
