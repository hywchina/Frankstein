{"instruction": "You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.\n\nI'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?", "output": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and want to end the trip on a positive note. However, it's important to consider your friend's perspective as well. There could be reasons why he's not enjoying the trip as much as you are, and it's possible that he's also feeling frustrated.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to try to resolve the situation:\n\n1. Talk to your friend: Approach your friend in a calm and respectful manner. Let him know how you're feeling and that you're finding it difficult to enjoy the trip because of the tension between you. Be specific about the things he's doing that are causing the tension, such as not engaging in conversation or wearing his airpods all the time.\n\n2. Listen to his perspective: Give your friend a chance to share his side of the story. He may have reasons for his behavior that you're not aware of. Listen actively and try to understand where he's coming from.\n\n3. Find common ground: Look for things you both enjoy and can agree on. This could be a specific activity, a type of food, or a place you'd like to visit. Focus on these shared interests and try to create positive experiences together.\n\n4. Consider a break: If the tension between you is too high, it might be helpful to take a break from each other for a day or two. This could give you both some space to reflect on the situation and come back with a fresh perspective.\n\n5. Plan for the future: If you decide to part ways in Wellington, make sure you have a plan for how you'll split the costs of the car and any other expenses. It's also a good idea to exchange contact information so you can stay in touch and potentially plan another trip together in the future.\n\nRemember, the goal is to end the trip on a positive note and maintain your friendship. Approach the situation with empathy and understanding, and try to find a solution that works for both of you.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
