{"instruction": "Can a qualifying manager work remotely abroad for US employer for an year be eligible for Eb1-C while on h1-b", "output": "The EB-1C visa is an employment-based immigrant visa for managers and executives who are transferring to a U.S. branch of their foreign employer. To be eligible for an EB-1C visa, the applicant must have been employed outside the U.S. for at least one year within the three years preceding the petition and must be coming to the U.S. to work in a managerial or executive capacity.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa for foreign workers in specialty occupations. To be eligible for an H-1B visa, the applicant must have a job offer from a U.S. employer and must meet certain educational and experience requirements.\n\nIt is possible for a qualifying manager to work remotely abroad for a U.S. employer for a year and then be eligible for an EB-1C visa, provided they meet all the other eligibility requirements. However, it is important to note that the EB-1C visa is an immigrant visa, which means that it leads to permanent residence in the U.S., while the H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa, which means that it allows the holder to work in the U.S. for a limited period of time.\n\nIf the qualifying manager is currently in the U.S. on an H-1B visa and wants to apply for an EB-1C visa, they may be able to do so without leaving the country, provided they meet all the eligibility requirements. However, if they are outside the U.S. and want to apply for an EB-1C visa, they will need to return to their home country to apply for the visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy.\n\nIt is recommended that the qualifying manager consult with an immigration attorney to determine the best course of action based on their specific circumstances.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
