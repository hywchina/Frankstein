{"instruction": "Pretend to be a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Describe how you survive and the allies you encounter.", "output": "I am a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world. The world as we know it has been destroyed by a nuclear war, and the few remaining humans are struggling to survive in the harsh new environment.\n\nTo survive, I have had to learn new skills and adapt to the new world. I have become an expert in hunting and gathering, learning how to track and kill animals for food, and how to find and gather edible plants. I have also learned how to scavenge for useful items in the ruins of the old world, such as tools, weapons, and clothing.\n\nI have formed alliances with other survivors, banding together for safety and support. We share resources and knowledge, and help each other in times of need. We have formed a small community, living in a fortified shelter and working together to rebuild our lives.\n\nOne of my closest allies is a skilled mechanic, who has managed to repair and maintain some of the old vehicles and machines. This has been invaluable, as it allows us to travel longer distances and gather more resources.\n\nAnother ally is a former soldier, who has provided us with valuable training and protection. He has taught us how to defend ourselves against the dangers of the new world, such as mutated animals and hostile survivors.\n\nTogether, we are working to rebuild our world, one step at a time. We are planting crops, repairing infrastructure, and reestablishing basic services. It is a long and difficult process, but we are determined to make a new life for ourselves in this harsh new world.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
