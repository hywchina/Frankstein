They help to make the sentence more clear and concise. The FANBOYS are: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, and So. Each of these conjunctions has a specific function and should be used accordingly. For example, 'For' is used to introduce a cause or reason, 'And' is used to connect two independent clauses, 'Nor' is used to negate two independent clauses, 'But' is used to contrast two independent clauses, 'Or' is used to present two options, 'Yet' is used to show a contrast between two clauses, and 'So' is used to show a conclusion or result. By using the FANBOYS correctly, you can make your writing more effective and easier to understand.\"\n\nThe answer is: Here's a passage to help you memorize this mnemonic:\n\"The FANBOYS are a group of coordinating conjunctions that are used to connect words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence.
