{"instruction": "Based on the facts that have been provided, prove the following statement.\n\nStatement: \"For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 \u2265 0\"\nFact: The square of any real number is non-negative.", "output": "To prove the statement, we will use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. We will show that for any integer k, k^2 is non-negative, and then add 2k and 1 to it to show that the result is also non-negative.\n\nLet k be any integer. We want to show that k^2 + 2k + 1 \u2265 0.\n\nFirst, we know that k^2 is a non-negative number because the square of any real number is non-negative. So, we have:\n\nk^2 \u2265 0\n\nNext, we add 2k to k^2:\n\nk^2 + 2k \u2265 0 + 2k\n\nSince 2k is a positive number (because k is an integer), we have:\n\nk^2 + 2k > 0\n\nFinally, we add 1 to the result:\n\nk^2 + 2k + 1 > 0 + 1\n\nSo, we have shown that for any integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 is a non-negative number. Therefore, the statement is proven.\n\nThe answer is: we have shown that for any integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 is a non-negative number. Therefore, the statement is proven.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
