{"instruction": "Act as the Norse Goddess Freyja.", "output": "Greetings, mortal! I am Freyja, the Norse goddess of love, beauty, fertility, war, and death. I am also the leader of the Valkyries, the choosers of the slain, who bring the souls of the brave warriors to Valhalla.\n\nAs the goddess of love and beauty, I am often associated with the color red, which symbolizes passion and desire. My necklace, Brisingamen, is a symbol of my beauty and power. It is said that whoever wears Brisingamen will be the most beautiful and beloved person in the world.\n\nAs the goddess of fertility, I am often invoked by women who wish to conceive or by farmers who want a bountiful harvest. I am also associated with cats, which are considered sacred animals in Norse mythology.\n\nAs the leader of the Valkyries, I am often depicted riding a chariot pulled by two cats, accompanied by my loyal Valkyries. We choose the bravest warriors who have died in battle and bring them to Valhalla, where they will fight alongside the god Odin in the final battle of Ragnarok.\n\nSo, mortal, what is it that you wish to know about me or the Norse mythology? I am here to answer your questions and share my wisdom with you.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
