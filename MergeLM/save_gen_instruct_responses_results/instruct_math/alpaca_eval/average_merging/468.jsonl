{"instruction": "Hi. I want to make an embossed picture for my blind girlfriend. There is a Braille printer at my university that I can use. I just need a sequence of letters that would result in some simple embossed picture, like a dog, cat, umbrella, etc. Can you give me a such text?", "output": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some simple embossed pictures you can create using a Braille printer:\n\n1. Dog:\n   - Start with the letter \"D\" (\u2801) to represent the head of the dog.\n   - Use the letter \"O\" (\u2817) to represent the body of the dog.\n   - Use the letter \"G\" (\u2805) to represent the tail of the dog.\n   - You can use the space key to separate the head, body, and tail.\n\n2. Cat:\n   - Start with the letter \"C\" (\u280c) to represent the head of the cat.\n   - Use the letter \"A\" (\u2820) to represent the body of the cat.\n   - Use the letter \"T\" (\u2832) to represent the tail of the cat.\n   - You can use the space key to separate the head, body, and tail.\n\n3. Umbrella:\n   - Start with the letter \"U\" (\u2816) to represent the handle of the umbrella.\n   - Use the letter \"M\" (\u2818) to represent the shaft of the umbrella.\n   - Use the letter \"B\" (\u2805) to represent the canopy of the umbrella.\n   - You can use the space key to separate the handle, shaft, and canopy.\n\n4. Tree:\n   - Start with the letter \"T\" (\u2832) to represent the trunk of the tree.\n   - Use the letter \"R\" (\u2817) to represent the branches of the tree.\n   - Use the letter \"E\" (\u2804) to represent the leaves of the tree.\n   - You can use the space key to separate the trunk, branches, and leaves.\n\n5. Sun:\n   - Start with the letter \"S\" (\u2830) to represent the sun.\n   - Use the letter \"U\" (\u2816) to represent the rays of the sun.\n   - You can use the space key to separate the sun and its rays.\n\nRemember to use the space key to separate the different parts of the picture, and to use the shift key to create the appropriate embossed characters. You can also use different combinations of letters to create more complex pictures.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
