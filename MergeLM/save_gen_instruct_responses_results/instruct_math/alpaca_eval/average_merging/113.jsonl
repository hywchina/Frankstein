{"instruction": "What color is the sky", "output": "The color of the sky is blue. This is because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is when sunlight hits the Earth's atmosphere and the shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer, red wavelengths. This is why we see the sky as blue during the day. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink due to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
