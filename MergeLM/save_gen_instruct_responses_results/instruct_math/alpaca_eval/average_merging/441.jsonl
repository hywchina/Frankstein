{"instruction": "what does the @ in python do", "output": "In Python, the \"@\" symbol is used to create a decorator function. A decorator function is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a modified version of that function. Decorators are often used to add additional behavior or functionality to an existing function.\n\nHere's an example of a simple decorator function:\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Before the function is called\")\n        result = func()\n        print(\"After the function is called\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef my_function():\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `my_decorator` function takes the `my_function` function as an argument and returns a new function, `wrapper`, that prints \"Before the function is called\" and \"After the function is called\" before and after calling `my_function`. The `@my_decorator` syntax is used to apply the `my_decorator` function to the `my_function` function, which means that `my_function` will now be replaced by the `wrapper` function whenever it is called.\n\nDecorators are a powerful feature of Python that can be used to add additional behavior to functions without modifying their source code. They are often used to create functions that have common behavior, such as logging or error handling, that can be applied to multiple functions in a program.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
