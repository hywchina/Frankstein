{"instruction": "Define what the underlined word means for kids.\n\n_keep a promise", "output": "To keep a promise means to do what you said you would do. It's like making a deal with someone and then sticking to it, no matter what. If you promise to do something, you should always try your best to do it, because breaking a promise can make people lose trust in you.\n\nFor example, if you promise your friend that you will come to their birthday party, you should make sure to show up. If something comes up and you can't make it, you should let your friend know as soon as possible so they can make other plans.\n\nKeeping a promise is important because it shows that you are reliable and trustworthy. When people know that you will do what you say, they are more likely to trust you and believe in you. So, always try to keep your promises, no matter how big or small they are.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
