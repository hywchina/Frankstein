{"instruction": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models", "output": "The dominant sequence transduction models are the models that are widely used and considered the best in the field of sequence transduction, which is the task of converting a sequence of tokens (such as words or characters) from one sequence to another. These models are typically based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input sequence and encodes it into a fixed-length vector representation, while the decoder takes the output sequence and decodes it from the fixed-length vector representation.\n\nThe best performing models among these also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different times, which helps it generate more accurate and fluent output.\n\nThe paper proposes a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely. This means that the Transformer does not have any loops or convolutional layers, which makes it more parallelizable and faster to train.\n\nThe experiments on two machine translation tasks show that the Transformer models are superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. The model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, which is an improvement over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, the Transformer establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, which is a significant improvement over the previous best results.\n\nThe paper also shows that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. This demonstrates that the Transformer is not only effective for sequence transduction tasks but can also be applied to other types of tasks.\n\nIn summary, the Transformer is a new simple network architecture that is based solely on attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely. It is more parallelizable and faster to train than the dominant sequence transduction models, and it achieves superior results on machine translation tasks and English constituency parsing tasks.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
