Here are some tips to help you successfully roast a pig:\n\n1. Choose the right pig: You'll want to choose a pig that is appropriate for the number of people you're serving. A whole pig can feed a lot of people, so make sure you have enough guests to enjoy it. You'll also want to choose a pig that is fresh and of good quality.\n\n2.

Be sure to carve the pig carefully to ensure that everyone gets an equal share of the meat.\n\nIn terms of equipment, you'll need a pig, a spit or grill, a meat thermometer, and some tools for cleaning and preparing the pig.
