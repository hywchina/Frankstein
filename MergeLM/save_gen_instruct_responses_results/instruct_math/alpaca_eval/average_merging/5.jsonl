Prepare your ingredient: Wash and peel the ingredient if necessary. Cut off any uneven edges or tough parts.\n3. Position your hand and knife: Place the ingredient on a cutting board and hold it firmly with one hand. Position the knife at a 90-degree angle to the ingredient.\n4. Make the first cut: Make a vertical cut through the ingredient, cutting about one-third of the way through. This will create a flat surface for you to work with.\n5. Make the second cut: Rotate the ingredient 90 degrees and make a horizontal cut through the ingredient, cutting about one-third of the way through. This will create a cube shape.\n6. Make the final cut: Rotate the ingredient 90 degrees again and make a vertical cut through the ingredient, cutting all the way through. This will create the final cube shape.\n7. Repeat the process: Continue cutting the ingredient into small cubes, making sure to keep your fingers away from the blade.\n\nBy following these steps, you can dice your ingredients safely and efficiently.
