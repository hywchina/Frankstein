{"instruction": "Implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures.", "output": "To find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Initialize two empty arrays, one for the common elements and one for the unique elements.\n2. Iterate through the first array and compare each element with the elements in the second array.\n3. If the element is found in the second array, add it to the common elements array.\n4. If the element is not found in the second array, add it to the unique elements array.\n5. After iterating through both arrays, the common elements array will contain all the common elements between the two arrays.\n\nHere's the Python code for this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    common_elements = []\n    unique_elements = []\n\n    for element in arr1:\n        if element in arr2:\n            common_elements.append(element)\n        else:\n            unique_elements.append(element)\n\n    return common_elements\n```\n\nThis function takes two arrays as input and returns a list of their common elements. Note that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the shorter array, because we need to iterate through both arrays for each element.\n\nThe answer is: Here's the Python code for this approach:\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    common_elements = []\n    unique_elements = []\n\n    for element in arr1:\n        if element in arr2:\n            common_elements.append(element)\n        else:\n            unique_elements.append(element)\n\n    return common_elements\n```\nThis function takes two arrays as input and returns a list of their common elements.
