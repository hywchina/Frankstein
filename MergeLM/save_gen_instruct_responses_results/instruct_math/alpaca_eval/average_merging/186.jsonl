{"instruction": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "output": "When you buy stock in a company, you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. The money you invest in the stock market goes to the company in exchange for this ownership. The company can then use this money to fund its operations, expand its business, or pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\nWhen you sell your stock, the money you receive goes back into the stock market. It can be used to buy more stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. The money can also be withdrawn from the stock market and deposited into your bank account.\n\nThe stock market itself is a complex system that connects buyers and sellers of stocks. When you buy or sell stock, you do so through a brokerage firm, which acts as an intermediary between you and the stock market. The brokerage firm uses the stock exchange to match buyers and sellers and to facilitate the transfer of ownership and money.\n\nIn summary, the money you invest in the stock market goes to the company you've bought stock from, which can use it to fund its operations or pay dividends. When you sell your stock, the money you receive goes back into the stock market, where it can be used to buy more stocks or other financial instruments, or withdrawn from the market and deposited into your bank account.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
