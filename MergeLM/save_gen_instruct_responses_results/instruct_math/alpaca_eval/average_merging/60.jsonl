{"instruction": "Please tell me the history of Walt Disney.", "output": "Walter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois. He was the fourth of five children born to Elias and Flora Disney. His father was a strict man who worked as a newspaper editor and later as a building contractor. His mother was a kind and creative woman who encouraged Walt's artistic talents.\n\nAs a child, Walt Disney showed a keen interest in drawing and storytelling. He began drawing cartoons at an early age and sold his first cartoon to a local newspaper when he was just 16 years old. After high school, he worked as a commercial artist and later joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps during World War I.\n\nIn 1919, Disney moved to Kansas City to pursue a career in animation. He worked for a film advertiser and later founded his own animation company, Laugh-O-Gram Studio. However, the company went bankrupt, and Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923.\n\nIn Hollywood, Disney met Ub Iwerks, a talented animator who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator. Together, they created the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit for Universal Pictures. However, Disney lost the rights to Oswald, and he and Iwerks created Mickey Mouse in 1928.\n\nMickey Mouse became an instant hit, and Disney founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio with his brother Roy. The studio produced the first Mickey Mouse cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie,\" which was the first cartoon with synchronized sound.\n\nIn the 1930s, Disney expanded his studio and began producing feature-length animated films, such as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937), \"Pinocchio\" (1940), and \"Fantasia\" (1940). He also introduced the world to Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto.\n\nDuring World War II, Disney produced propaganda and training films for the U.S. government. After the war, he began producing live-action films and television shows. In 1950, he opened Disneyland, an amusement park in Anaheim, California.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Disney continued to produce animated films, such as \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955), \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959), and \"The Jungle Book\" (1967). He also opened Walt Disney World in Florida in 1971.\n\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, before the completion of \"The Jungle Book.\" He was 65 years old. Today, his company, The Walt Disney Company, is one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with interests in film, television, theme parks, and consumer products.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
