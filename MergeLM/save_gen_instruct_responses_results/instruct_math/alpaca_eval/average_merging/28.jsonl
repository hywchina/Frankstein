{"instruction": "Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "output": "Kobe beef is considered one of the most expensive and luxurious types of beef in the world. It is known for its marbling, tenderness, and rich flavor. The high price of Kobe beef is due to several factors:\n\n1. Limited supply: Kobe beef is only produced in the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle, which are raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan. The number of these cattle is limited, and the production process is strictly controlled.\n\n2. High-quality feed: Kobe beef cattle are fed a special diet that includes beer, sake, and grains. This diet is expensive and contributes to the high cost of the beef.\n\n3. Aging process: Kobe beef is aged for a minimum of 21 days to 60 days, which allows the meat to become more tender and flavorful. This process also adds to the cost of the beef.\n\n4. Export restrictions: Kobe beef is only exported to a few countries, including the United States, Canada, and Hong Kong. The limited availability of Kobe beef outside of Japan contributes to its high price.\n\n5. Marketing and branding: Kobe beef is a well-known and prestigious brand, and its high price is partly due to the prestige and exclusivity associated with it.\n\nOverall, the combination of limited supply, high-quality feed, aging process, export restrictions, and marketing and branding contribute to the high price of Kobe beef.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
