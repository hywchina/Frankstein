{"instruction": "Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.", "output": "To find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Define a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n2. Initialize two variables `fib_prev` and `fib_next` to 0 and 1, respectively. These variables represent the previous and next Fibonacci numbers.\n3. Create a table `fib_table` with dimensions `n+1` x `2` to store the Fibonacci numbers.\n4. Iterate through the table, starting from the second row (index 1) and the second column (index 0).\n5. For each cell in the table, calculate the Fibonacci number using the formula `fib_next = fib_prev + fib_next`, and then update the cell with the result.\n6. After filling the table, the nth Fibonacci number can be found in the nth row and first column.\n\nHere's the Python code for this approach:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n\n    fib_prev = 0\n    fib_next = 1\n    fib_table = [[0, 1]]\n\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        fib_prev, fib_next = fib_next, fib_prev + fib_next\n        fib_table.append([fib_prev, fib_next])\n\n    return fib_table[n-1][0]\n\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. The function initializes two variables `fib_prev` and `fib_next` to 0 and 1, respectively, and creates a table `fib_table` with dimensions `n+1` x `2` to store the Fibonacci numbers. The function then iterates through the table, updating the Fibonacci numbers for each cell, and finally returns the nth Fibonacci number from the table.\n\nThe output of this program is 55, which is the 10th Fibonacci number.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
