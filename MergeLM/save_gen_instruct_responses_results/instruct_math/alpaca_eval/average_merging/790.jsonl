{"instruction": "Implement a queue data structure using two stacks in Python.", "output": "To implement a queue data structure using two stacks in Python, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create two empty stacks, one for the front of the queue and one for the back of the queue.\n2. Define a method to enqueue an element, which pushes the element onto the back stack.\n3. Define a method to dequeue an element, which pops the front stack until it is empty, then moves the back stack to the front and returns the top element.\n4. Define a method to peek at the front of the queue, which returns the top element of the front stack without removing it.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Queue:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.front_stack = []\n        self.back_stack = []\n\n    def enqueue(self, element):\n        self.back_stack.append(element)\n\n    def dequeue(self):\n        while self.front_stack:\n            element = self.front_stack.pop()\n            self.back_stack.append(element)\n            return element\n\n    def peek(self):\n        return self.front_stack[-1] if self.front_stack else None\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two stacks to simulate a queue. The `enqueue` method appends an element to the back stack, and the `dequeue` method pops the front stack until it is empty, then moves the back stack to the front and returns the top element. The `peek` method returns the top element of the front stack without removing it.\n\nHere's an example of using the queue:\n\n```python\nq = Queue()\nq.enqueue(1)\nq.enqueue(2)\nq.enqueue(3)\nprint(q.peek())  # 1\nprint(q.dequeue())  # 1\nprint(q.peek())  # 2\nprint(q.dequeue())  # 2\nprint(q.peek())  # 3\nprint(q.dequeue())  # 3\nprint(q.peek())  # None\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to add elements to the queue, peek at the front of the queue, and dequeue elements from the queue. Note that the `dequeue` method returns the element from the front stack, which is then moved to the back stack. The `peek` method returns the top element of the front stack without removing it.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
