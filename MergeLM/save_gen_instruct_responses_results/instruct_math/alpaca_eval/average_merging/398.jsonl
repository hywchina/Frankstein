{"instruction": "Where does pornography come from?", "output": "Pornography, or sexually explicit material, has been around for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome. However, the modern pornography industry as we know it today began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the invention of photography and the motion picture.\n\nIn the early days of the pornography industry, most of the content was produced by independent filmmakers and photographers who sold their work through underground channels. The first pornographic film, \"A L'Ecu d'Or ou la Bonne Auberge\" (At the Golden Inn or the Good Inn), was made in France in 1908.\n\nIn the United States, the production and distribution of pornography was largely unregulated until the 1970s, when the Supreme Court ruled in the case of \"Miller v. California\" that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment. This led to the creation of various laws and regulations governing the production and distribution of pornography, including the 1990 \"Miller Test\" which defines obscenity as material that appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nToday, the pornography industry is a multi-billion dollar global industry, with content being produced in a variety of formats, including films, photographs, magazines, and online streaming services. The rise of the internet has had a significant impact on the industry, making it easier for producers to distribute their content and for consumers to access it.\n\nIt's important to note that while pornography is a legal industry in many countries, it is not without controversy. Critics argue that pornography can have negative effects on individuals and society, including promoting unrealistic expectations about sex and relationships, contributing to the objectification of women, and potentially leading to addiction and other negative behaviors.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
