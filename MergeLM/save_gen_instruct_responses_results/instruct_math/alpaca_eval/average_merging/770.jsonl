{"instruction": "How many words are spoken daily on Earth? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "output": "Estimating the total number of words spoken daily on Earth is a complex task due to the vast number of people and languages involved. However, we can make an educated guess based on some assumptions and available data.\n\n1. Population: As of 2021, the world population is approximately 7.9 billion people.\n\n2. Languages: There are over 7,000 languages spoken in the world, with some people speaking more than one language.\n\n3. Average words per person: The average number of words spoken by a person per day varies greatly depending on the individual's age, profession, and social situation. However, a rough estimate for an average adult is around 16,000 words per day.\n\n4. Conversation rate: People spend a significant portion of their day conversing with others. Assuming an average of 30 minutes per day in conversation, we can estimate the number of words spoken per person per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of words spoken daily on Earth:\n\nTotal words spoken = (Total population) * (Average words per person) * (Conversation rate)\n\nTotal words spoken = (7.9 billion) * (16,000) * (0.5 hours/day)\n\nTotal words spoken = 6.74 trillion words per day\n\nThis is a rough estimate and may not be entirely accurate due to the many variables involved. However, it gives us an idea of the enormous amount of words spoken daily on Earth.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
