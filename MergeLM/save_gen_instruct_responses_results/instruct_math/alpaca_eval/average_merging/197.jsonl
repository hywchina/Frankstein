{"instruction": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "output": "Hops are typically added to the brewing process at three different stages: during the boil, during the whirlpool, and during the fermentation process.\n\n1. During the boil: Hops are added to the boiling wort (unfermented beer) to provide bitterness, flavor, and aroma. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they will contribute. This is typically the most important addition of hops in the brewing process.\n\n2. During the whirlpool: After the boil, the wort is cooled and transferred to a vessel for the whirlpool stage. Hops can be added during this stage to provide additional flavor and aroma. The hops are not boiled during this stage, so they will contribute less bitterness.\n\n3. During the fermentation process: Hops can be added during the fermentation process to provide additional flavor and aroma. This is less common, but some brewers may choose to do this to achieve a specific flavor profile.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific timing and amount of hops added at each stage can vary greatly depending on the style of beer being brewed and the brewer's personal preferences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
