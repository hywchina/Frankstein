{"instruction": "What is the Balfour Declaration?", "output": "The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War. The declaration expressed support for the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, then an area under Ottoman rule. The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration was a significant event in the history of the Middle East and the Jewish people. It was seen as a key step towards the eventual establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. However, it also contributed to tensions in the region and remains a source of controversy to this day.\n\nThe full text of the Balfour Declaration is as follows:\n\n\"His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\"\n\nThe Balfour Declaration is often cited as a key event in the history of Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. It is also a source of controversy, as some argue that it led to the displacement of Palestinian Arabs and the creation of a state that is seen as illegitimate by many in the region.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
