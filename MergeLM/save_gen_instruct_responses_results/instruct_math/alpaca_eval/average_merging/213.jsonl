{"instruction": "what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot", "output": "The recommended pattern for creating games in Godot is to use the Scene-based architecture. This pattern involves creating a hierarchy of scenes, where each scene represents a different level, screen, or state in the game.\n\nHere's a general outline of the Scene-based architecture:\n\n1. Create a root scene: This is the main scene that contains all other scenes in the game. It's responsible for managing the game's state and transitioning between scenes.\n2. Create scene nodes: These are nodes that contain the game logic and assets for each scene. You can have multiple scene nodes for different levels, screens, or states in the game.\n3. Connect scene nodes to the root scene: Use the `connect(\"scene_changed\", root, \"change_scene\")` method to connect each scene node to the root scene. This will allow the root scene to detect when a scene node is changed and transition to the appropriate scene.\n4. Implement the `change_scene()` method in the root scene: This method should contain the code to transition from one scene to another. You can use the `get_node()` method to get the scene node that was changed and then call its `change_scene()` method to transition to the new scene.\n5. Implement the `scene_changed()` method in the scene nodes: This method should contain the code to clean up the scene node before it's destroyed and to set up the new scene node when it's created.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can create a modular and scalable game architecture that makes it easy to add new levels, screens, and states to your game.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
