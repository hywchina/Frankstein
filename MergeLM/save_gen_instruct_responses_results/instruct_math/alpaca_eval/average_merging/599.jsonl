{"instruction": "Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.", "output": "In German, verbs can end in different ways depending on the tense, mood, and voice. Here are some common endings for German verbs:\n\n1. Regular present tense: Most German verbs are conjugated in the present tense by adding a suffix to the stem of the verb. The suffix depends on the person and number of the subject. For example, the verb \"to eat\" (essen) in the present tense would be conjugated as follows:\n\n- I eat (ich esse)\n- You eat (du esst)\n- He/she/it eats (er/sie/es esst)\n- We eat (wir essen)\n- You (plural) eat (ihr essen)\n- They eat (sie essen)\n\n2. Regular past tense: The past tense in German is formed by adding a suffix to the stem of the verb. The suffix depends on the person and number of the subject. For example, the verb \"to eat\" (essen) in the past tense would be conjugated as follows:\n\n- I ate (ich a\u00df)\n- You ate (du a\u00dft)\n- He/she/it ate (er/sie/es a\u00df)\n- We ate (wir a\u00dfen)\n- You (plural) ate (ihr a\u00dft)\n- They ate (sie a\u00dfen)\n\n3. Irregular verbs: Some German verbs do not follow the regular conjugation patterns. For example, the verb \"to be\" (sein) in the present tense is conjugated as follows:\n\n- I am (ich bin)\n- You are (du bist)\n- He/she/it is (er/sie/es ist)\n- We are (wir sind)\n- You (plural) are (ihr seid)\n- They are (sie sind)\n\nIn the past tense, the verb \"to be\" is conjugated as follows:\n\n- I was (ich war)\n- You were (du warst)\n- He/she/it was (er/sie/es war)\n- We were (wir waren)\n- You (plural) were (ihr waren)\n- They were (sie waren)\n\n4. Commands: To form a command in German, you add the infinitive of the verb to the end of the sentence. For example:\n\n- Eat! (Essen!)\n- Be! (Sei!)\n\n5. Questions: To form a question in German, you add a question mark at the end of the sentence. For example:\n\n- Do you eat? (Esst du?)\n- Are you eating? (Ist du essend?)\n\nThese are just a few examples of how German verbs can end. The conjugation of verbs in German can be quite complex, but with practice and exposure to the language, you will become more familiar with the different endings and patterns.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
