BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe sun is shining brightly over the turquoise waters of Miami Beach. The camera pans across the beach, showing the palm trees swaying in the breeze and the beachgoers soaking up the sun.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe camera enters the club, which is packed with people dancing and enjoying themselves. The DJ is spinning some upbeat tunes, and the bar is bustling with activity.\n\nWe see JdeG, a tall, lanky man with a shaved head and a goatee, pouring drinks behind the bar. He's wearing a white tank top and a pair of board shorts.\n\nSophieSnazz, a blonde, bubbly woman with a British accent, is working the other side of the bar. She's wearing a tight, red bikini and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nAs JdeG hands a drink to a customer, he notices SophieSnazz chatting up a group of guys at the end of the bar. He rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath.\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(whispering)\nHey, JdeG, check out these guys. They're total studs.\n\nJDEG\n(sarcastically)\nOh, great. Just what we need. More douchebags trying to pick up chicks at Beefy's.\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(laughing)\nLighten up, JdeG. It's just a little harmless flirting.\n\nJDEG\n(sighing)\nI know, I know. It's just... I don't know. I guess I'm just not in the mood today.\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(patting him on the shoulder)\nIt's okay, JdeG. We all have our off days.\n\nJust then, the door to the club opens, and a tall, muscular man with a shaved head and a goatee walks in. He's wearing a white tank top and a pair of board shorts, and he has a confident swagger as he makes his way to the bar.\n\nBEEFY\n(to JdeG)\nHey, JdeG. How's it going?\n\nJDEG\n(smiling)\nHey, Beefy. It's going good. How's business?\n\nBEEFY\n(nodding)\nIt's been good. The tourists are loving it.\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(to Beefy)\nHey, Beefy. How's it going?\n\nBEEFY\n(smiling)\nHey, SophieSnazz. It's going good. How's your day been?\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(smiling)\nIt's been great. I've been chatting up some studs at the end of the bar.\n\nBEEFY\n(laughing)\nOh, really? Well, I hope you're having more luck than JdeG here. He's been in a bit of a funk lately.\n\nJDEG\n(rolling his eyes)\nGreat. Just what I need. Beefy sticking his nose in my business.\n\nBEEFY\n(laughing)\nHey, I'm just trying to help, man. You know I'm always here for you.\n\nJDEG\n(smiling)\nI know, Beefy. I appreciate it.\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(to Beefy)\nSo, Beefy, what's the plan for tonight?\n\nBEEFY\n(smiling)\nWell, I was thinking about having a little party at my place. You know, just a few friends, some drinks, some music. What do you say?\n\nSOPHIESNARZZ\n(excitedly)\nOh, that sounds like fun! I'm in!\n\nJDEG\n(smiling)\nSounds like a plan. Count me in.\n\nBEEFY\n(smiling)\nGreat! I'll text you the details later.\n\nThe camera pans out as Beefy walks away, and the scene fades to black.\n\nTHE END.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
