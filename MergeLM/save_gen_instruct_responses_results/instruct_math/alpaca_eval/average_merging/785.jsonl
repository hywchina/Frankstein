{"instruction": "Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.", "output": "Here's a simple C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream inputFile;\n    string line;\n    string wordToFind = \"your_word_here\";\n    int count = 0;\n\n    inputFile.open(\"your_file_here.txt\");\n\n    if (inputFile.is_open()) {\n        while (getline(inputFile, line)) {\n            if (line.find(wordToFind) != string::npos) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n        inputFile.close();\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Error opening file.\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"The word \" << wordToFind << \" occurs \" << count << \" times in the file.\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo use this program, replace \"your_file_here.txt\" with the name of your text file and \"your_word_here\" with the word you want to find in the file. Then, run the program and it will output the number of occurrences of the specified word in the file.\n\nThe program opens the text file using an ifstream object, which is a stream that reads from a file. It then enters a loop that reads each line of the file using the getline function. For each line, it checks if the line contains the specified word using the find function. If the word is found, it increments a counter. After reading all the lines, the program closes the file and outputs the number of occurrences.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the text file is in the same directory as the program file. If the file is in a different directory, you will need to provide the full path to the file.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "vicuna"}
