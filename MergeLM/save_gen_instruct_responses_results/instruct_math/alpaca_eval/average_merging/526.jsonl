{"instruction": "React properly to reviews from your customers. In your responses, you can highlight your business' policies and customer service.\n\nAnother repeat visit and no disappointment from us. Great place for breakfast or brunch - and you won't need to eat again for awhile. The restaurant is close to the Tenderloin so be aware of your surroundings.\nWe enjoyed the Succotash Omelet (at least my wife enjoyed it), the Pulled Pork Benedict and the Hangtown Fry. Portions are large and pricing is fair. I wish we could have managed a Beignet Flight!\nDefinitely a spot to seek out. It can be crowed at times so be patient. Well worth any wait.", "output": "Dear [Customer Name],\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review of your recent visit to our restaurant.
