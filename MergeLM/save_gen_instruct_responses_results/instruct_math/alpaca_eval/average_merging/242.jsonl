{"instruction": "in billiards what happens if on the break every strip ball is pocketed?", "output": "In billiards, if on the break every striped ball is pocketed, the result is a foul. The player who committed the foul loses their turn, and the other player gets ball-in-hand, meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table before their shot.\n\nThe rules for fouls in billiards are as follows:\n\n1. If a player pockets the cue ball or drives it off the table.\n2. If a player pockets the white ball.\n3. If a player pockets a ball that is not the object ball.\n4. If a player pockets the object ball but does not make contact with any numbered ball.\n5. If a player pockets the object ball but makes contact with only one numbered ball.\n6. If a player pockets the object ball but makes contact with more than one numbered ball.\n7. If a player pockets a striped ball on the break.\n\nIn the case of a foul, the other player gets ball-in-hand, meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table before their shot. If the player who committed the foul was the first player in the game, the other player becomes the first player. If the player who committed the foul was the second player, the game continues with the second player becoming the first player.\n\nIt's important to note that the rules for fouls can vary depending on the specific game of billiards being played. For example, some games may have different rules for fouls or different penalties for fouls. It's always best to check the specific rules of the game being played before starting.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
