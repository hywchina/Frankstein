It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n1. Medication: Based on the information provided, it seems like your current medication regimen is appropriate for managing your diabetes and kidney disease. However, it is important to note that dapagliflozin may not be suitable for everyone with kidney disease, so it is important to discuss this with your doctor.\n\n2. Exams: In addition to regular check-ups with your doctor, you may want to consider getting a kidney ultrasound to assess the structure of your kidneys and a bone density scan to assess your risk of osteoporosis (which can be a side effect of some diabetes medications).\n\n3. Exercise and Diet: Regular physical activity and a healthy diet are important for managing diabetes and kidney disease. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, and focus on eating a balanced diet that is low in salt, fat, and sugar.\n\n4. Switching to Insulin: The decision to switch to insulin should be made in consultation with your doctor. Generally, insulin is recommended when oral medications are no longer effective in controlling blood sugar levels. However, some people with kidney disease may need to switch to insulin earlier due to the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).\n\n5. Avoiding Dialysis: While there is no guaranteed way to avoid dialysis, maintaining good control of your diabetes and kidney disease through medication, diet, and exercise can help slow the progression of kidney disease. It is also important to follow your doctor's recommendations for regular check-ups and any additional tests or treatments that may be necessary.\n\nRemember, this is general information and you should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "koala"}
