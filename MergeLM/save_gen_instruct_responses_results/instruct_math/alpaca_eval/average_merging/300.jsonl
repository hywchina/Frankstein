Pressing ESC will quit the game. The FPS counter will update every frame and display the current FPS.\n\nThe code uses the `pygame.event.get()` function to handle events, including the ESC key for quitting the game. The `time.perf_counter()` function is used to calculate the FPS, and the `pygame.font.SysFont()` function is used to create the FPS counter font. The `pygame.display.flip()` function is used to update the screen. Finally, the `pygame.quit()` function is used to clean up and close the window.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/average_merging", "dataset": "oasst"}
