{"instruction": "Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?", "output": "The tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving in the United States is believed to have originated from the Pilgrims who celebrated the first Thanksgiving in 1621. The Pilgrims were English settlers who had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620. They were struggling to survive in the new land and had a difficult first winter, with many of them dying from disease and malnutrition.\n\nIn the spring of 1621, the Pilgrims were able to plant crops and hunt game, which helped them to have a successful harvest. To celebrate their good fortune, they invited the local Native American tribe, the Wampanoag, to a feast. The Wampanoag had helped the Pilgrims by teaching them how to farm and hunt in the new land.\n\nThe feast lasted for three days and included a variety of foods, including venison (deer meat), wild fowl (probably ducks and geese), and corn. There is no record of turkey being served at the first Thanksgiving, but it is likely that it was eaten by the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag. Turkeys were a common food source for both groups, and they were abundant in the area.\n\nOver time, the tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving became more widespread in the United States. In the 19th century, President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday, and it was celebrated on different days in different states. In 1863, Lincoln set the date for Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November, which is the date that is still observed today.\n\nBy the early 20th century, turkey had become the traditional centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal in many American households. This was due in part to the efforts of the poultry industry, which promoted turkey as a festive and economical choice for the holiday. Today, turkey is the most popular meat in the United States, and it is estimated that over 46 million turkeys are consumed on Thanksgiving each year.\n\nSo, while there is no definitive answer as to why turkey became the official food of Thanksgiving, it is likely that its association with the Pilgrims, its abundance in the New England area, and its promotion by the poultry industry all played a role in its becoming the traditional centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
