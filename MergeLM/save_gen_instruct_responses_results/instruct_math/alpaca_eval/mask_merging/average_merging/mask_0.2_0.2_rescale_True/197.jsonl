{"instruction": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "output": "Hops are typically added to the brewing process at three different stages: during the boil, during the whirlpool, and during the fermentation process.\n\n1. During the boil: Hops are usually added at the beginning of the boil to provide bitterness and flavor to the beer. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they will contribute.\n\n2. During the whirlpool: After the boil, the wort (unfermented beer) is cooled and transferred to a vessel for the whirlpool stage. Hops can be added during this stage to provide additional flavor and aroma.\n\n3. During the fermentation process: Hops can also be added during the fermentation process to provide additional flavor and aroma. This is typically done with hop pellets or whole hops, which are added to the fermenter and allowed to steep for a period of time before being removed.\n\nThe specific timing and amount of hops added at each stage will depend on the style of beer being brewed and the desired flavor profile. Some brewers may also use dry-hopping, which involves adding hops to the beer after the fermentation process is complete, to provide additional aroma and flavor.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
