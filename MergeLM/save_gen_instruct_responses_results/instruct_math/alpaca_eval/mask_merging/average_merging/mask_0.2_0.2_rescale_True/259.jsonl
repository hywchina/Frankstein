{"instruction": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "output": "The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature, and this phenomenon is known as blackbody radiation. The relationship between the temperature of an object and the wavelength of the light it emits is described by Planck's law of blackbody radiation.\n\nPlanck's law states that the energy distribution of a blackbody (an object that absorbs all incident light) is a function of temperature (T) and is given by:\n\nE(\u03bb) = (2/c^3) * \u0127 * (1/\u03bb^5) * (1/(e^(\u0127c/\u03bbkT) - 1))\n\nwhere:\n- E(\u03bb) is the energy emitted at wavelength \u03bb,\n- \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant,\n- c is the speed of light,\n- k is the Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature of the blackbody, and\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the light emitted by a blackbody (the wavelength at which the most energy is emitted) can be found by taking the derivative of Planck's law with respect to \u03bb and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndE(\u03bb)/d\u03bb = 0\n\nSolving this equation for \u03bb gives:\n\n\u03bb = (c/2) * (1/kT)\n\nThe wavelength of the light emitted by a blackbody increases as the temperature decreases. For example, at room temperature (approximately 300 K), the peak wavelength of the light emitted by a blackbody is around 10 \u03bcm. As the temperature decreases, the peak wavelength increases, and at very low temperatures (close to absolute zero), the peak wavelength can be several meters.\n\nIn the case of metals, they do not emit light at all at room temperature. However, when heated to very high temperatures, they can emit light in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The wavelengths of the light emitted by metals at high temperatures depend on the specific metal and its temperature.\n\nIn summary, the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature, and they can be determined using Planck's law of blackbody radiation. At room temperature, metals do not emit light, but at high temperatures, they can emit light in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
