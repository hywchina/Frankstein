{"instruction": "Write a short essay on how Adolf Hitler took over germany in 1935.", "output": "Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany began in 1933 when he was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler's Nazi Party had been gaining popularity since the early 1930s, and he was able to capitalize on the economic and political instability of the time to gain support.\n\nOnce in power, Hitler began to consolidate his control over the government and the military. He used his position as Chancellor to pass laws that gave him more power and authority, and he began to purge the government of anyone who opposed him. He also used propaganda and intimidation to silence his critics and maintain control over the population.\n\nIn 1934, Hitler took advantage of the death of President von Hindenburg to assume the role of President himself. This gave him even more power and authority, and he began to implement his plans for Germany.\n\nOne of Hitler's main goals was to rearm Germany and prepare it for war. He began to secretly rebuild the German military, which had been limited by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles following World War I. He also began to annex neighboring countries, such as Austria and Czechoslovakia, in order to expand Germany's territory and resources.\n\nIn 1935, Hitler took another major step in his plan to take over Germany when he passed the Nuremberg Laws. These laws stripped Jews of their citizenship and civil rights, and they paved the way for the persecution and eventual genocide of millions of Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nBy 1935, Hitler had effectively taken over Germany and was in control of its government, military, and society. He would go on to lead Germany into World War II, which would result in the deaths of millions of people and the destruction of much of Europe.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
