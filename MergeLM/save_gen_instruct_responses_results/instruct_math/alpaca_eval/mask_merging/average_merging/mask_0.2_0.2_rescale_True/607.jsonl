Box 1 has the number 8 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 1, 2, and 5. Box 2 has the number 3 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 1, 9, and 7. Box 3 has the number 6 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 2, 5, and 9. Box 4 has the number 2 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 4, 8, and 6. Box 5 has the number 7 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 3, 8, and 1. Box 6 has the number 5 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 4, 1, and 3. Box 7 has the number 8 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 6, 7, and 1. Box 8 has the number 3 in the top-left corner, so we can fill in the rest of the box with 9, 1, and 7.\n\nNow, we can fill in the missing numbers in the rows and columns based on the constraints of the 3x3 boxes.\n\nAfter filling in all the missing numbers, we get the following solved Sudoku puzzle:\n\n|1|  |5|  |  |  |  |8|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |3|  |6|4|\n|8|3|4|6|7|  |9|  |  |\n|2|9|1|  |  |8|3|7|6|\n|  |  |6|  |  |9|8|1|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |2|  |  |  |\n|  |2|  |  |9|7|6|  |  |\n|5|4|  |  |  |  |  |9|8|\n|6|1|  |  |  |5|4|3|7|\n\nThe answer is: We can start by filling in the missing numbers in the 3x3 boxes.
