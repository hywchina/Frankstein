The referee for this match was Kato Masao.\n\nThe game was named the Atomic Bomb Game because of the speed at which the players played. The game lasted only 20 minutes, and both players played very aggressively, making it seem like an atomic bomb had been dropped on the board.\n\nThe game is considered one of the most exciting and memorable games in the history of Go. It's a must-watch for any Go enthusiast.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
