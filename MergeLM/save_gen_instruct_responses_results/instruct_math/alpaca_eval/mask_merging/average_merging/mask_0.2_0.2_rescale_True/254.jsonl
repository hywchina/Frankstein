{"instruction": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Dev\u00e8ze", "output": "1. Climate change: African agriculture faces the challenge of adapting to changing weather patterns and increasing temperatures, which can lead to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.\n2. Soil degradation: Overuse of land and poor farming practices have led to soil erosion and degradation, reducing the productivity of African farms.\n3. Water scarcity: Many African countries face water scarcity, which limits the availability of water for irrigation and other agricultural purposes.\n4. Infrastructure: Poor roads, lack of electricity, and inadequate storage facilities hinder the transportation and marketing of agricultural products, reducing the income of farmers.\n5. Pests and diseases: African farmers face the challenge of controlling pests and diseases that can damage crops and reduce yields.\n6. Lack of technology: Many African farmers lack access to modern farming technologies, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and machinery, which can increase productivity.\n7. Limited access to credit: African farmers often lack access to credit, which can limit their ability to invest in their farms and improve their production.\n8. Low productivity: African agriculture is characterized by low productivity, which is due to a variety of factors, including poor soil fertility, inadequate use of inputs, and limited access to technology.\n9. Market access: Many African farmers face challenges in accessing markets, which can limit their income and prevent them from selling their products at a fair price.\n10. Policy and institutional challenges: African governments face challenges in designing and implementing policies that support agricultural development, and in strengthening the institutions that support the sector.\n\nThe summary above is based on the book \"Challenges for African Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Dev\u00e8ze. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges facing African agriculture and offers recommendations for addressing these challenges.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
