{"instruction": "Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.\n\nA study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.", "output": "The article discusses a study conducted by Zee and her team that explores the impact of light on sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. The study found that sleeping with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, can increase blood sugar and heart rate. This is concerning because elevated heart rate during sleep has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels can indicate insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that even low levels of light can disrupt sleep and have negative health consequences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
