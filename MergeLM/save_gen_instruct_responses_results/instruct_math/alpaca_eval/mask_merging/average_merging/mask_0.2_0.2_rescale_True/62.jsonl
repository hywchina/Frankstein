{"instruction": "How did serial killers get away with murder for so long in the 70s and 80s?", "output": "Serial killers were able to get away with murder for extended periods of time in the 1970s and 1980s for a variety of reasons. Some of these factors include:\n\n1. Lack of technology: Forensic science and DNA testing were not as advanced in the 1970s and 1980s as they are today. This made it more difficult for law enforcement to link crimes to specific individuals.\n2. Poor communication between law enforcement agencies: In many cases, local police departments did not share information with other agencies, which made it easier for serial killers to move from one area to another without being detected.\n3. Inadequate training: Police officers and forensic scientists often lacked the training and resources needed to properly investigate and solve serial murder cases.\n4. Media coverage: The media often sensationalized serial killers, which made them more notorious and gave them a sense of power. This could lead to copycat crimes and make it more difficult for law enforcement to catch the original killer.\n5. Societal attitudes: In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a growing distrust of authority figures, which made it harder for law enforcement to gain the public's cooperation in solving crimes. Additionally, there was a belief that serial killers were rare and could not be caught, which led to a lack of vigilance and reporting of suspicious activity.\n\nOverall, a combination of these factors allowed many serial killers to operate undetected for extended periods of time in the 1970s and 1980s. However, as forensic science and law enforcement techniques have advanced, it has become increasingly difficult for serial killers to avoid detection.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
