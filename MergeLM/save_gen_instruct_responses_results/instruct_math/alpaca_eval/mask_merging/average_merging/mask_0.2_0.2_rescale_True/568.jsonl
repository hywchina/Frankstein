{"instruction": "You will need to guide this person through the scenario they have described for the interview.\n\nFinally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.\nWhew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.\nNow you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.\nWhen suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.\n\"What if we thought of the problem this way?\"\nYou feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:\n\"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!\"", "output": "It's a common experience for many developers to feel overwhelmed during a coding interview, especially when the interviewer introduces a new perspective or approach to the problem. Here are some tips to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. Stay calm and focused: It's important to maintain your composure and not let the new information distract you from your current solution. Take a deep breath and try to understand the new perspective before reacting.\n\n2. Ask clarifying questions: If you're unsure about the new approach or how it relates to your current solution, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This will help you understand the interviewer's perspective and determine the best way to proceed.\n\n3. Evaluate the new approach: Once you understand the new perspective, take some time to evaluate its merits. Consider how it compares to your current solution and whether it might be more efficient or effective.\n\n4. Make a decision: Based on your evaluation, decide whether to stick with your current solution or adopt the new approach. If you choose to switch, make sure you can clearly articulate why you made that decision.\n\n5. Communicate your decision: Let the interviewer know what you've decided and why. Be prepared to defend your decision and explain how it addresses the problem or the new perspective.\n\nRemember, the goal of a coding interview is to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and ability to think on your feet. By staying calm, asking questions, evaluating the new approach, making a decision, and communicating your decision, you can show the interviewer that you can handle unexpected challenges and adapt to new information.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
