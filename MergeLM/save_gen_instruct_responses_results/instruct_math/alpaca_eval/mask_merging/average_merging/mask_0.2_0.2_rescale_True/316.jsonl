{"instruction": "Can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem?", "output": "Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous theorem in number theory that was first proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637. It states that there are no integer solutions to the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for n > 2, where a, b, and c are integers and n is a positive integer greater than 2.\n\nFermat wrote in the margin of a book that he had a proof for this theorem, but he never published it. It was not until 1670 that the theorem was first proven by the Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens. However, his proof was not widely accepted and was later found to have a flaw.\n\nThe theorem was finally proven in 1994 by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles, who spent seven years working on the problem. His proof was published in a series of articles in the journal Annals of Mathematics and was hailed as one of the most significant achievements in mathematics in the 20th century.\n\nThe proof is quite complex and involves advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory. It is not possible to explain the entire proof here, but it essentially involves using elliptic curves and modular forms to show that there are no integer solutions to the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for n > 2.\n\nFermat's Last Theorem is an important result in number theory because it demonstrates that there are limits to the simplicity and symmetry of the solutions to Diophantine equations, which are equations that involve only integers. It also highlights the difficulty and complexity of proving such results, as it took over 350 years to find a definitive proof.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
