{"instruction": "Imagine you have a FEN notation of a chessboard. How can you draw a board to show this state of the chessboard in LATEX? Create a LATEX code that includes all the required commands and packages.", "output": "To draw a chessboard in LATEX, you can use the `chessboard` package. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{chessboard}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{chessboard}\n\\setboardsize{8cm}\n\\pieceset{white}{white}\n\\postion{start}\n\\end{chessboard}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code will create a chessboard with a size of 8cm and white pieces. You can change the size and the color of the pieces by adjusting the corresponding options.\n\nTo add a FEN notation to the chessboard, you can use the `fen` package. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{chessboard, fen}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{chessboard}\n\\setboardsize{8cm}\n\\pieceset{white}{white}\n\\postion{start}\n\\end{chessboard}\n\n\\fen{start}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code will create a chessboard with a size of 8cm and white pieces, and then display the FEN notation `start` above the board. You can change the position of the FEN notation by adjusting the `above` option.\n\nNote that the `chessboard` and `fen` packages are not compatible with each other, so you need to load them in this specific order. Also, the `chessboard` package requires the `graphicx` package to be loaded before it.\n\nThe final code would look like this:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx, chessboard, fen}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{chessboard}\n\\setboardsize{8cm}\n\\pieceset{white}{white}\n\\postion{start}\n\\end{chessboard}\n\n\\fen{start}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code will create a chessboard with a size of 8cm and white pieces, and then display the FEN notation `start` above the board.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
