{"instruction": "Where does pornography come from?", "output": "Pornography, or explicit sexual content, has been around for thousands of years and can be found in various forms across different cultures. The word \"pornography\" comes from the Greek words \"pornos\" (prostitute) and \"graphos\" (writing), which together mean \"writing about prostitutes.\"\n\nThe earliest known pornographic images date back to ancient civilizations such as Greece, Rome, and Egypt. These images were often found in temples, tombs, and other public places. In ancient Greece, for example, pornographic images were used to decorate brothels and bathhouses.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, pornography was less common due to the influence of the Catholic Church, which considered sex outside of marriage to be sinful. However, erotic literature and art continued to be produced in secret.\n\nThe modern pornography industry as we know it today began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the invention of photography and the motion picture. The first pornographic film, \"Le Coucher de la Marie,\" was made in 1896. In the 1970s, the pornography industry experienced a boom with the advent of video technology, which made it easier to produce and distribute pornographic content.\n\nToday, pornography is a multi-billion dollar industry that produces a wide range of content, including films, magazines, websites, and other forms of media. It is consumed by people of all ages and backgrounds around the world.\n\nIt's important to note that while pornography can be a form of entertainment for some, it can also have negative effects on individuals and society. These include addiction, unrealistic expectations about sex, and the objectification of women and other marginalized groups.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
