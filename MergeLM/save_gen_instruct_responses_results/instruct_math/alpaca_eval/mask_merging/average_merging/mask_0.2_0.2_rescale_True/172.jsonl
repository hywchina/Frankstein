{"instruction": "In this math problem, we are asked to figure out the percentage of total profits that are made in each quarter. They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters?", "output": "To find the total profit percent over a period of time, we need to add up the percentages of profits made in each quarter and then divide the sum by the total number of quarters.\n\nStep 1: Add up the percentages of profits made in each quarter.\n90% (Q1) + 92% (Q2) + 81% (Q3) + 88% (Q4) = 351%\n\nStep 2: Divide the sum of the percentages by the total number of quarters.\n351% / 4 quarters = 87.75%\n\nStep 3: Convert the decimal to a percentage.\n87.75% \u2248 88%\n\nSo, the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters, is approximately 88%.\n\nThe answer is: the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters, is approximately 88%.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
