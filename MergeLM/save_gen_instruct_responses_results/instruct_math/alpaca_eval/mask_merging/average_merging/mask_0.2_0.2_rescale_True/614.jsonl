{"instruction": "Prove the given statement using your information.\n\n\"If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.\"", "output": "We are given that x is a positive integer or a solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4. We need to prove that x > 0 and x > 12.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where x is a positive integer. Since x is a positive integer, it is greater than 0 by definition. Also, since x is a positive integer, it is greater than 12 by definition (as 12 is the smallest positive integer). Therefore, in this case, x > 0 and x > 12.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where x is a solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4. This inequality can be rewritten as x > -3. Since x is greater than -3, it is greater than 0. Also, since -3 is less than 12, x is also greater than 12. Therefore, in this case, x > 0 and x > 12 as well.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that regardless of whether x is a positive integer or a solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4, x is always greater than 0 and greater than 12. Therefore, the given statement is proven to be true.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
