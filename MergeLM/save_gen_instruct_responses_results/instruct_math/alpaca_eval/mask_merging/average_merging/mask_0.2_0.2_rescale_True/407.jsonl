{"instruction": "What is the james webb telescope", "output": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space observatory that will be launched into space in 2021. It is designed to replace the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in operation since 1990. The JWST will be the most powerful space telescope ever built, with a primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal segments that will be 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter.\n\nThe JWST will be stationed at the L2 point, a location in space about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This location is known as the second Lagrange point, and it is a gravitational balance point between Earth and the Sun. From this vantage point, the JWST will be able to observe the universe in infrared light, which will allow it to see through dust clouds and observe distant objects that are too old or too far away for the Hubble Space Telescope to see.\n\nThe JWST is expected to make significant contributions to our understanding of the universe, including the study of the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, the formation of planets and planetary systems, and the search for life beyond Earth. It will also be used to study the atmospheres of exoplanets and to observe the universe in unprecedented detail.\n\nThe JWST is a joint project between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, and it has been in development since 1996. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $8.7 billion, making it one of the most expensive scientific instruments ever built.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
