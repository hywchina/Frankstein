This will help take their mind off their problems and create a positive atmosphere.\n\n3. Send a funny meme or video: If you know your friend's sense of humor, send them a funny meme or video that you think they'll enjoy. This can help lighten the mood and make them laugh.\n\n4. Offer to help: If you know what's bothering them, offer to help in any way you can. This could be anything from running an errand to helping with a project.\n\n5. Give them a small gift: A small gift, like a book, a candle, or a piece of candy, can brighten up their day. Make sure it's something you know they'll like.\n\n6. Plan a surprise: Plan a surprise for your friend, like a surprise party or a surprise outing. This will definitely put a smile on their face.\n\nRemember, the key is to be supportive and understanding.
