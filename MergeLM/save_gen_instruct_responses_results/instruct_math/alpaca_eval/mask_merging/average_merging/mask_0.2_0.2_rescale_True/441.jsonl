{"instruction": "what does the @ in python do", "output": "In Python, the \"@\" symbol is used to create a decorator function. A decorator function is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a modified version of that function. Decorators are often used to add additional behavior or functionality to an existing function.\n\nHere's an example of a simple decorator function:\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"This function is being called before the original function!\")\n        func()\n        print(\"This function is being called after the original function!\")\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef my_function():\n    print(\"This is the original function!\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `my_decorator` function takes the `my_function` function as an argument and returns a new function, `wrapper`, that prints a message before and after calling `my_function`. The `@` symbol is used to apply the `my_decorator` function to the `my_function` function, which means that `my_function` will now be called inside the `wrapper` function.\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll see the following output:\n\n```\nThis function is being called before the original function!\nThis is the original function!\nThis function is being called after the original function!\n```\n\nSo, the `@` symbol in Python is used to create decorator functions, which can be used to add additional behavior or functionality to existing functions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
