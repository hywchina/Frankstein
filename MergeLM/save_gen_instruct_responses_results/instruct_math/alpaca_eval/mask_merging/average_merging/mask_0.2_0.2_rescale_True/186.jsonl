{"instruction": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "output": "When you buy stock in a company, you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. The money you invest in the stock market goes to the company in exchange for this ownership. The company can then use this money to fund its operations, expand its business, or pay off debts.\n\nWhen you sell your stock, the money you receive goes back into the stock market. It can be used to buy more stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. The money can also be withdrawn from the stock market and deposited into your bank account.\n\nThe stock market itself is a complex system that connects buyers and sellers of stocks. When you buy a stock, you are buying it from another investor who is selling. The stock market acts as an intermediary, facilitating these transactions and ensuring that the price of the stock is fair.\n\nIn summary, the money you invest in the stock market goes to the company you've bought stock from, which can use it to fund its operations and grow its business. When you sell your stock, the money you receive goes back into the stock market, where it can be used to buy more stocks or other financial instruments, or withdrawn from the market and deposited into your bank account.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
