It works by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1 (which is not prime), then iterating through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is, then `n` is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\nTo automate code generation, you can use a code generation tool or framework, such as Sphinx or Doxygen, to generate documentation or API reference from your Python code. These tools can help you create a detailed description of your function, its parameters, and its return values, which can be used as a reference for other developers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a code generation library, such as `ast` or `codegen`, to generate Python code based on a template or a set of rules. For example, you can create a template for a function and use it to generate multiple functions with different parameters or return values.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that code generation should be used with caution, as it can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain. It's generally better to write code manually, as it allows you to control the structure and style of your code more effectively.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
