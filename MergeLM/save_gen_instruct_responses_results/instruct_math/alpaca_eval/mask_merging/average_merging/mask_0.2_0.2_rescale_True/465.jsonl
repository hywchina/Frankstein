{"instruction": "What is the Balfour Declaration?", "output": "The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War. The declaration expressed support for the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, then an area under Ottoman rule. The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary at the time.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration was a significant milestone in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was seen as a promise by the British government to support the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, which was then inhabited by a majority of Arabs and a minority of Jews. The declaration was welcomed by Zionist leaders, who saw it as a step towards the realization of their goal of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. However, it was also opposed by Arab leaders and many Palestinians, who feared that it would lead to the displacement of the Arab population and the loss of their land.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration was incorporated into the British Mandate for Palestine, which was established after the war and lasted until 1948. The declaration remains a contentious issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with both sides claiming it as a basis for their claims to the land.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
