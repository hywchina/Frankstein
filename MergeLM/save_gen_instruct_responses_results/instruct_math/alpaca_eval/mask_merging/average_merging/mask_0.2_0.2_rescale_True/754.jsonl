{"instruction": "Pretend to be a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Describe how you survive and the allies you encounter.", "output": "I am a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world. The world as we know it has been destroyed by a nuclear war, and the few remaining humans are struggling to survive in the harsh new environment.\n\nTo survive, I have had to learn new skills and adapt to the new world. I have become an expert in hunting and gathering, learning how to track and kill animals for food, and how to find and gather edible plants. I have also learned how to scavenge for useful items in the ruins of the old world, such as tools, weapons, and clothing.\n\nI have formed alliances with other survivors, banding together for safety and support. We share resources and knowledge, and help each other in times of need. We have formed a small community, living in a fortified shelter and working together to rebuild our lives.\n\nOne of my closest allies is a skilled mechanic named Jack. He has managed to repair and maintain some of the old vehicles, which we use for transportation and to scavenge for supplies. He has also built a small generator, which provides us with electricity and allows us to power some of the old appliances and tools.\n\nAnother ally is a young woman named Sarah. She is a skilled hunter and has taught me much about tracking and hunting. She is also a talented healer, and has saved many of our lives with her knowledge of herbs and medicine.\n\nTogether, we face the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world, working to rebuild our lives and create a new future for ourselves and our community.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
