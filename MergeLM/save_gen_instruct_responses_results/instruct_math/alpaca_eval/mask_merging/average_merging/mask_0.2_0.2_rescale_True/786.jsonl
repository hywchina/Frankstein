{"instruction": "Implement a Python function to find the longest common subsequence of two input strings using dynamic programming.", "output": "To find the longest common subsequence of two input strings using dynamic programming, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Define a function `lcs(s1, s2, i1, i2)` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2`, and two indices `i1` and `i2` representing the current positions in the two strings.\n2. If either `i1` or `i2` is greater than the length of their respective string, return an empty string, as there are no more characters to compare.\n3. If the characters at positions `i1` and `i2` are the same, append them to the result and increment `i1` and `i2` by 1.\n4. If the characters at positions `i1` and `i2` are different, find the longest common subsequence of the two strings starting from the current positions and including the current character. To do this, call the `lcs` function recursively with the same strings and the new indices `i1 + 1` and `i2 + 1`.\n5. Return the result of the recursive call as the longest common subsequence of the two strings.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef lcs(s1, s2, i1, i2):\n    if i1 > len(s1) or i2 > len(s2):\n        return ''\n    if s1[i1] == s2[i2]:\n        result = s1[i1]\n        i1 += 1\n        i2 += 1\n        return result\n    else:\n        return lcs(s1, s2, i1 + 1, i2 + 1)\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"AGGTAB\"\ns2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\nprint(lcs(s1, s2, 0, 0))  # Output: \"GXTXAYB\"\n```\n\nThe output of the above code is \"GXTXAYB\", which is the longest common subsequence of the two input strings.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(min(len(s1), len(s2)) * max(len(s1), len(s2))), as it makes a single pass through both strings and compares each character at most twice (once for each string). The space complexity is O(min(len(s1), len(s2))), as it stores the result of the recursive calls.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
