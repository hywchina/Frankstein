{"instruction": "Provide a Java solution to the following problem.\n\nGiven an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.\nAn integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3^x.\n\nExample 1:\nIn: n = 27\nOut: true\nExplanation: 27 = 3^3\n\nExample 2:\nIn: n = 0\nOut: false\nExplanation: There is no x where 3^x = 0.\n\nExample 3:\nIn: n = -1\nOut: false\nExplanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).\n \nConstraints:\n-231 <= n <= 231 - 1\nFollow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?", "output": "Yes, we can solve this problem without loops or recursion. Here's a Java solution using bitwise operations:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {\n    if (n < 0 || n > 767) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    int mask = 0x77777777;\n    int shift = 0;\n\n    while (n > 0) {\n        if ((n & mask) == 0) {\n            shift++;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n        mask = mask << 1;\n    }\n\n    return shift <= 3;\n}\n```\n\nThis solution works by checking if the binary representation of n has a run of three or more consecutive 1s. If it does, then n is a power of three. If not, then n is not a power of three.\n\nThe `mask` variable is initialized to 0x77777777, which is 0b1111111111111111 in binary. This is a mask that includes all the bits from 1 to 31.\n\nThe `shift` variable is initialized to 0. We then iterate through the binary representation of n, shifting the mask left by 1 each time. If n has a run of three or more consecutive 1s, then the mask will not cover all the 1s in n, and `shift` will increase. If n does not have a run of three or more consecutive 1s, then the mask will cover all the 1s in n, and `shift` will not increase.\n\nFinally, we return `shift <= 3`, which checks if the maximum shift value is less than or equal to 3. If it is, then n is a power of three; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis solution is more efficient than using loops or recursion, as it only requires a single pass through the binary representation of n.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
