It's always tough when things don't go as planned. Would you like to talk about it?\n\n+ Yeah, I guess. I had a big project due today and I didn't finish it on time.\n- That's a bummer. Did you have any issues with the project itself or was it just a matter of not having enough time?\n\n+ It was a combination of both. The project was more complex than I thought and I underestimated the time it would take to complete it.\n- I understand how that can happen. It's easy to overlook the details when you're excited about a project. Did you have any support from your classmates or teachers?\n\n+ My teacher was understanding and gave me an extension, but I still feel bad about not finishing on time.\n- It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and has off days. It's how we learn and grow from those experiences. You should be proud of yourself for trying your best and for having the courage to ask for help when you needed it.\n\n+ Thanks, I guess you're right. I just need to learn from this and do better next time.\n- Absolutely. We all have our ups and downs, but it's how we respond to them that matters. Keep your head up and keep moving forward.\n\n+ Thanks for listening. I feel a bit better now.\n- You're welcome. I'm here if you ever need to talk.
