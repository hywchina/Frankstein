It's called Armillaria ostoyae, also known as the honey mushroom, and it covers over 2,200 acres in Oregon, USA. It's estimated to be around 2,400 years old!\n\nThe fungus grows underground, forming a network of fine, white threads called mycelium. These threads spread out in search of nutrients, eventually forming a massive, interconnected network that covers the entire area. The fungus is so large that it can be seen from space!\n\nThe honey mushroom is not only the largest living organism, but it's also one of the oldest. It's been around since before the Roman Empire, and it's still growing today. It's a fascinating example of how nature can create incredible things if given the chance.\n\nSo, the next time you're out in the forest, remember that you're walking on top of a giant, ancient organism that's been around for thousands of years!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
