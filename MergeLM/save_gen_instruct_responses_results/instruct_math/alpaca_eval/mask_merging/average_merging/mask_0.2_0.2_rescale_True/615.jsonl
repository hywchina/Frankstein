{"instruction": "Based on the facts that have been provided, prove the following statement.\n\nStatement: \"For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 \u2265 0\"\nFact: The square of any real number is non-negative.", "output": "To prove the statement, we will use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. We will show that for any integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 is a real number and is non-negative.\n\nLet k be any integer. Then, k^2 is a non-negative real number because the square of any real number is non-negative. Now, let's consider the expression k^2 + 2k + 1. \n\nWe can rewrite this expression as (k^2 + 2k) + 1. Since k^2 and 2k are both non-negative real numbers, their sum (k^2 + 2k) is also a non-negative real number. Adding 1 to a non-negative real number only increases its value, so (k^2 + 2k) + 1 is also a non-negative real number.\n\nTherefore, for every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 \u2265 0.
