{"instruction": "How do I wrap a present neatly?", "output": "Wrapping a present neatly can be a fun and creative process. Here are some steps to help you wrap a present neatly:\n\n1. Choose the right wrapping paper: Select a paper that complements the gift and the occasion. You can choose from a variety of patterns, colors, and textures. Make sure the paper is large enough to cover the gift completely.\n\n2. Measure the gift: Before you start wrapping, measure the length, width, and height of the gift to determine the size of the paper you need.\n\n3. Cut the paper: Cut the paper to the appropriate size using scissors or a paper cutter. Make sure the paper is large enough to wrap the gift completely and to fold over the edges.\n\n4. Fold the paper: Fold the paper in half lengthwise to create a crease. This will help you align the edges as you wrap the gift.\n\n5. Place the gift: Place the gift on the paper, making sure it is centered and the edges are even.\n\n6. Start wrapping: Begin wrapping the gift by folding one edge of the paper over the gift and taping it in place. Continue wrapping the gift, folding the paper over the gift and taping it in place as you go. Make sure the paper is smooth and wrinkle-free.\n\n7. Finish wrapping: When you reach the top of the gift, fold the paper over the top and tape it in place. Then, fold the remaining paper under the gift and tape it to the bottom of the gift.\n\n8. Add a bow: To finish the presentation, add a bow to the top of the gift. You can use a pre-made bow or create your own using ribbon or string.\n\n9. Add a tag: If desired, add a tag to the gift with the recipient's name or a personal message.\n\nBy following these steps, you can wrap a present neatly and beautifully. Remember to have fun and be creative with your wrapping paper choices and bow designs.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
