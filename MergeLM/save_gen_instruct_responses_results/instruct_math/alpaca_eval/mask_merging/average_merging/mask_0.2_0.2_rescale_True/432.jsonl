Its distance from Earth is approximately 25,000 to 28,000 light-years. In parsecs, it is about 8.3 to 9.5 kiloparsecs.\n\nFor comparison, the center of the Andromeda galaxy is approximately 2.5 million light-years away from Earth. In parsecs, it is about 770 kiloparsecs.\n\nSo, Sgr A* is much closer to Earth than the center of the Andromeda galaxy.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
