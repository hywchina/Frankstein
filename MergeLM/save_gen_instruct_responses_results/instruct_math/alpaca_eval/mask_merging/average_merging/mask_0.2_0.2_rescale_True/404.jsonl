{"instruction": "what is the color of mars", "output": "The color of Mars is often described as reddish or rusty. This is due to the presence of iron oxide, also known as hematite, in the planet's soil and rocks. The iron oxide gives Mars its distinctive color. However, the color can vary depending on the time of day and the season, as well as the specific location on the planet. For example, the polar regions of Mars are covered in ice and dust, which can give them a more blueish tint.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
