Obtain a type rating: A type rating is a specific certification that allows you to fly a particular type of aircraft. For fighter jets, you would need to obtain a type rating from the CAA. This involves additional training and exams specific to the fighter jet you wish to fly.\n\n3. Obtain an airworthiness certificate: Before you can operate a fighter jet, you must ensure that it meets the airworthiness standards set by the CAA. This involves having the aircraft inspected by a certified mechanic and obtaining an airworthiness certificate.\n\n4. Obtain insurance: You must have adequate insurance coverage for the fighter jet to cover any potential damages or injuries that may occur during operation.\n\n5. Comply with airspace regulations: You must comply with all airspace regulations in New Zealand, including obtaining permission to fly in restricted airspace and following all rules for takeoff and landing.\n\n6. Comply with noise regulations: Fighter jets can be quite loud, so you must comply with all noise regulations in New Zealand to avoid disturbing nearby residents.\n\n7. Comply with environmental regulations: You must also comply with all environmental regulations in New Zealand to minimize the impact of your fighter jet operations on the environment.\n\n8. Maintain the fighter jet: You must ensure that the fighter jet is properly maintained and serviced to ensure its safety and airworthiness.\n\n9. Train regularly: To maintain your skills and proficiency, you must regularly train in the fighter jet. This may involve attending flight schools or hiring a certified instructor.\n\n10. Stay up-to-date with regulations: Finally, you must stay up-to-date with any changes to the regulations and requirements for owning and operating a fighter jet in New Zealand.\n\nBy following these steps and meeting all the requirements, you can legally own and operate a fighter jet in New Zealand.
