The player who committed the foul loses their turn, and the other player gets ball-in-hand, meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table before their shot.\n\nThe rules for fouls in billiards are as follows:\n\n1. If a player pockets the cue ball or drives it off the table.\n2. If a player pockets the white ball.\n3. If a player pockets a ball that is not the object ball.\n4. If a player pockets the object ball but also pockets a striped ball.\n\nIn this case, the fourth rule applies, and the player who committed the foul loses their turn.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
