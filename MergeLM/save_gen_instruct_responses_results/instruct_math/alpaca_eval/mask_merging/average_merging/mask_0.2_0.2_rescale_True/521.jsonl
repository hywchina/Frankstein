{"instruction": "You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.\n\nI'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?", "output": "It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and want to end the trip on a positive note. However, it's important to consider your friend's perspective as well. There could be reasons why he's not enjoying the trip or engaging in conversation that you're not aware of.\n\nBefore you make any decisions, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your friend. Let him know how you're feeling and why you think the trip isn't living up to your expectations. Be specific about the things you've tried to do to engage him in conversation and the activities you've done together.\n\nAsk him if there's anything he's not enjoying or if there's anything he'd like to do differently. This will give you both a chance to address any issues and find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nIf, after having this conversation, you still feel that the trip isn't working out and you want to split up, it's important to do so amicably. You can suggest that you each go your separate ways for the rest of the trip, and that you'll both meet up again at the end to part ways.\n\nRemember to be respectful and understanding, and try to end the trip on a positive note. You never know, you might both end up having a great time once you're apart. Good luck!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
