{"instruction": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called", "output": "Antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called isotropic antennas. Isotropic antennas are theoretical antennas that radiate energy equally in all directions, similar to how a light bulb emits light in all directions. In reality, no antenna can be perfectly isotropic due to physical constraints, but some antennas come close to this ideal. For example, antennas with a gain of 0 dBi (decibels) are considered isotropic, as they have a gain of 0 dBi in the horizontal direction and a gain of 0 dBi in the vertical direction.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
