This will help the kernels to pop more evenly and will also infuse the popcorn with a delicious flavor. You can use any type of oil you prefer, such as vegetable oil, coconut oil, or even flavored oils like truffle or garlic oil. Simply add a teaspoon or two of oil to the popcorn kernels before popping them in a pan or an air popper. This will result in a more flavorful and aromatic popcorn that is sure to impress.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
