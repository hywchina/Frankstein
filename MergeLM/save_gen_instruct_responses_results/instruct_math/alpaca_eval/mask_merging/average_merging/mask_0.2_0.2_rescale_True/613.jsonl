{"instruction": "Solve this equation.\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0", "output": "To solve the equation x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0, we can try to factor it or use numerical methods. In this case, we can try factoring by grouping.\n\nStep 1: Group the terms\nWe can group the terms in pairs:\n(x^3 - 4x^2) + (6x - 24) = 0\n\nStep 2: Factor out the common factors\nWe can factor out the common factors from each pair:\nx^2(x - 4) + 2(3x - 12) = 0\n\nStep 3: Factor further\nNow, we can factor further by finding two numbers that multiply to 24 and add up to 12. These numbers are 8 and 3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\nx^2(x - 4) + 8(3x - 12) = 0\n\nStep 4: Factor out the common binomial factor\nWe can factor out the common binomial factor (3x - 12):\n3x(x - 4) - 8(3x - 12) = 0\n\nStep 5: Factor out the common binomial factor\nWe can factor out the common binomial factor (3x - 12) again:\n3x(x - 4) - 8(3x - 12) = 0\n\nStep 6: Set each factor equal to zero\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n3x(x - 4) = 8(3x - 12)\n\n3x^2 - 12x = 24x - 96\n\nStep 7: Rearrange the equation\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n3x^2 - 24x + 96 = 0\n\nStep 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -24, and c = 96. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (24 \u00b1 \u221a((-24)^2 - 4(3)(96))) / (2(3))\nx = (24 \u00b1 \u221a(576 - 1152)) / 6\nx = (24 \u00b1 \u221a(-576)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0 has no real roots.\n\nThe answer is: There are no real roots for the equation x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
