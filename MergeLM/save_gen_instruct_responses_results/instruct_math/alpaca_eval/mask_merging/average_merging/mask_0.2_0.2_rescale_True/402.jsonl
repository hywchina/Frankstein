{"instruction": "Given two matrices A and B which you can multiply together, does (A B)^T = A^T B^T or B^T A^T?", "output": "The transpose of a matrix product is not necessarily equal to the product of the transposes of the matrices. In general, (AB)^T \u2260 A^T B^T or B^T A^T.\n\nTo see why, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have two matrices A and B:\n\nA = | 1 2 |\n    | 3 4 |\n\nB = | 5 6 |\n    | 7 8 |\n\nNow, let's compute the product AB:\n\nAB = | 1*5 + 2*7 1*6 + 2*8 |\n    | 3*5 + 4*7 3*6 + 4*8 |\n\nAB = | 15 20 |\n    | 23 36 |\n\nNow, let's compute the transpose of AB:\n\n(AB)^T = | 15 23 |\n        | 20 36 |\n\nNow, let's compute the transpose of A and B:\n\nA^T = | 1 3 |\n     | 2 4 |\n\nB^T = | 5 7 |\n     | 6 8 |\n\nNow, let's compute the product of the transposes of A and B:\n\nA^T B^T = | 1*5 + 3*7 1*6 + 3*8 |\n         | 2*5 + 4*7 2*6 + 4*8 |\n\nA^T B^T = | 15 26 |\n         | 35 52 |\n\nAs we can see, (AB)^T \u2260 A^T B^T or B^T A^T. In this case, (AB)^T = | 15  23 |\n                                                                | 20  36 |\nwhile A^T B^T = | 15  26 |\n                 | 35  52 |\n\nSo, the answer is: (AB)^T \u2260 A^T B^T or B^T A^T.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
