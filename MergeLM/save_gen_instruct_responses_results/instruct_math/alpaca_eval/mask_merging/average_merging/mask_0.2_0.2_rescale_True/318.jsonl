This includes both stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes. Stellar-mass black holes are formed from the collapse of a massive star, while supermassive black holes are found at the center of galaxies and can have masses equivalent to millions or even billions of suns. The discovery of black holes is an ongoing process, and new ones are being discovered all the time through various methods such as observing the behavior of stars and gas in galaxies, and detecting gravitational waves.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
