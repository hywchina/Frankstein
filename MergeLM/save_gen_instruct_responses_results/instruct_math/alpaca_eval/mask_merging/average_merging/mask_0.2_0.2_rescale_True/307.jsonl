{"instruction": "I have an almost irrational hatred for the American version of \"The Office\". I've never really watched it though, nor the original British version. Give me a plausible explanation that I can use when/if people ask me why I dislike it.", "output": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a possible explanation:\n\n\"I've never been a fan of the American version of 'The Office' because I find it to be a pale imitation of the original British series. The British version, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, is a masterpiece of comedy and satire that has stood the test of time. It's a show that's both hilarious and poignant, with a cast of characters that are complex and relatable.\n\nOn the other hand, the American version, while it has its moments, often feels like a cheap imitation. The characters are one-dimensional and the humor is more slapstick and crass than the subtle, witty humor of the original. Additionally, the American version lacks the emotional depth and complexity of the British version, which is what makes it such a beloved classic.\n\nSo, while I can appreciate the American version for what it is, I prefer the original British version for its superior writing, acting, and overall quality. It's a show that I can watch over and over again and still find new things to appreciate.\"\n\nThis explanation should give you a good starting point for explaining your dislike of the American version of \"The Office\" to others.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
