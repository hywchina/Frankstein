We fight for the independence of Skyrim from the Empire, and for the rights of the Nords to rule our own land.\n\nFor too long, the Empire has oppressed us, taken our resources, and treated us as second-class citizens. We will not stand for it any longer. We will fight for our freedom, and we will win.\n\nThe Empire thinks us barbarians, uncivilized and uncouth. But they do not understand our way of life. We are warriors, born and bred to fight and die for our people. We are proud of our heritage, and we will not let the Empire take that away from us.\n\nWe are not alone in this fight. The Dark Brotherhood, the Companions, and many other factions stand with us. Together, we will bring down the Empire and restore Skyrim to its former glory.\n\nSo, to all those who would stand against us, I say this: you will not defeat us. We are the Nords, and we will not be conquered. We will fight to the last man, and we will emerge victorious.\n\nFor Skyrim! For the Nords! For freedom!\"", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
