Here are a few great games that have been released for the Nintendo Switch in the past year or so:\n\n1. Super Mario Odyssey - This is a must-have for any Nintendo fan. It's a 3D platformer that takes Mario on a journey across various kingdoms, each with their own unique style and challenges.\n2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - This is another classic Nintendo game that has been reimagined for the Switch. It's an open-world adventure game that lets you explore a vast world and solve puzzles to save Hyrule.\n3. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - If your nephew loves racing games, this is a great choice. It's a remastered version of the Wii U game, with all the tracks and characters you know and love, plus some new ones.\n4. Splatoon 2 - This is a third-person shooter game where you play as a squid-like character and battle it out with ink guns. It's a lot of fun and has a great multiplayer mode.\n5. Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! - These are two new games in the Pok\u00e9mon series that let you catch and train Pok\u00e9mon in a more relaxed, casual way. They're perfect for younger players or those who want a more laid-back gaming experience.\n\nI hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
