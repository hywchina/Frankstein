{"instruction": "Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the game of racquetball to you!\n\nRacquetball is a sport played with two or four players in a court with four walls. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that your opponent is unable to return it. The ball can be hit with either the front or back of the racquet, and players can use the walls to bounce the ball in order to hit it.\n\nThe game is played in a court that is 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. The front wall is the wall that the players face when they are at the service line, and the back wall is the wall opposite the front wall. The side walls are the walls that run parallel to the front and back walls.\n\nThe game starts with a serve, where one player hits the ball against the front wall in such a way that it bounces off the floor and hits the back wall before the opponent can return it. After the serve, players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall so that it bounces off the floor and hits the back wall before their opponent can return it.\n\nPoints are scored when a player is unable to return the ball before it hits the floor or goes out of bounds. If the ball hits the ceiling, it is considered out of bounds and the point goes to the other player. If the ball hits the floor before it hits the back wall, the point also goes to the other player.\n\nThe game is played to 15 points, and a player must win by two points. If the score is tied at 14-14, the game continues until one player leads by two points.\n\nThere are several variations of racquetball, including singles (one player against one player), doubles (two players against two players), and cutthroat (three players, with one player against the other two).\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the game of racquetball! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
