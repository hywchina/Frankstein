{"instruction": "Recommend some helpful activities or conversation starters to use at meetups to break the ice.", "output": "Here are some fun and engaging activities and conversation starters that you can use at meetups to break the ice and get people talking:\n\n1. Icebreaker Questions: Start with some simple questions like \"What's your name?\" and \"Where are you from?\" to get people comfortable with each other. Then move on to more interesting questions like \"What's your favorite book?\" or \"If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?\"\n\n2. Two Truths and a Lie: Each person takes turns sharing three statements about themselves, two of which are true and one of which is false. The others have to guess which statement is the lie. This game is a great way to learn interesting facts about each other and can lead to some fun and unexpected conversations.\n\n3. Speed Networking: Set a timer for a few minutes and have everyone pair up with someone they don't know. Each person has to introduce themselves and share one interesting fact about themselves. After the timer goes off, switch partners and repeat the process. This is a great way to meet new people and learn about their interests.\n\n4. Group Storytelling: Start a story and have each person add one sentence to it. The story can be funny, serious, or anything in between. This activity encourages creativity and teamwork, and it's a great way to get to know each other better.\n\n5. Scavenger Hunt: Create a list of items or tasks that people have to find or complete. This can be as simple or as complex as you want, and it's a fun way to explore the area and get to know each other better.\n\n6. Karaoke: If the meetup allows it, set up a karaoke machine and let people take turns singing their favorite songs. This is a great way to break the ice and have some fun.\n\n7. Team Building Activities: If the meetup is focused on a specific topic or interest, plan some team building activities related to that topic. For example, if the meetup is for a book club, you could have a trivia contest or a discussion about the book.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a relaxed and welcoming environment where people feel comfortable talking to each other. So, choose activities that are fun and engaging, and don't be afraid to mix things up to keep the conversation flowing.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
