One of the most notable was Robert C. Weaver, who served as the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1966 to 1968. He was the first African American to serve in a presidential cabinet.\n\nWeaver was a key figure in the civil rights movement, advocating for fair housing and equal opportunity. He played a crucial role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing. Weaver also helped to establish the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was created to address issues of urban poverty and housing discrimination.\n\nAfter leaving the cabinet, Weaver continued to work on civil rights issues, serving as the first director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter. He also founded the National Urban League's Washington Bureau, where he worked to advance the cause of civil rights and social justice.\n\nWeaver's legacy as a trailblazer and advocate for civil rights continues to inspire generations of Americans. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
