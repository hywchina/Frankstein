The subarray can be of any length, and the list can contain duplicate elements.\n\nExample:\n\nGiven the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is 15 (which can be obtained by selecting the subarray [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. The list will have at least one element.\n2. The list will contain at most 10^4 elements.\n3. The elements in the list will be integers within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can create a table (or an array) to store the maximum sum of all possible subarrays of the given list. The table will have a length equal to the length of the list plus one (to account for the empty subarray).\n\nHere's the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the table with zeros.\n2. For each element in the list, update the table by adding the current element to the maximum sum of all subarrays ending at that element.\n3. Return the maximum value in the table.\n\nHere's the Python code for the algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_subarray(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = arr[i - 1]\n        for j in range(i):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i])\n\n    return dp[n]\n\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(max_sum_subarray(arr))  # Output: 15\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n), as we are using an array of size n to store the maximum sums.\n\nThe answer is: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n), as we are using an array of size n to store the maximum sums.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
