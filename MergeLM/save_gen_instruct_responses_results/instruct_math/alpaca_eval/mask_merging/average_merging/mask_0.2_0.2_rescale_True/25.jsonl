{"instruction": "What are some species of bears that are now extinct?", "output": "There are several species of bears that are now extinct. These include:\n\n1. The Cave Bear (Ursus spelaeus): This species lived in Europe during the Pleistocene era and became extinct around 24,000 years ago. It was larger than the modern brown bear and had a more robust build.\n\n2. The Giant Panda Bear (Ailuropoda megacolon): This species is not technically extinct, but it is considered endangered. There are only around 1,800 individuals left in the wild.\n\n3. The Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos ornatus): This species is also not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable. It is found in the forests of South America and is the only bear species native to the continent.\n\n4. The Short-faced Bear (Arctodus simus): This species lived in North America during the Pleistocene era and became extinct around 11,000 years ago. It was larger than the modern brown bear and had a short snout.\n\n5. The Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus): This species is not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable. It is found in the forests of South Asia and is known for its slow movements and long claws.\n\n6. The Brown Bear (Ursus arctos): This species is not extinct, but it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its range. It is found in North America, Europe, and Asia and is the most common bear species in the world.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many species of bears that are now extinct or vulnerable. It is important to protect the remaining bear species and their habitats to ensure their survival.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
