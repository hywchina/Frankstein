This early VM OS is the foundation for the development of modern virtualization software. Today, this software is referred to as a hypervisor.\n\nHardware virtualization is a technology that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, sharing its resources. This is done by creating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking resources for each virtual machine. This allows cloud providers to efficiently utilize their hardware resources and provide customers with the impression of having dedicated resources.\n\nThe concept of virtualization is implemented physically using hypervisor modules. These modules are installed on top of an operating system (OS), which acts as an interface between the hardware units and the hypervisor packages. In other words, the OS provides the necessary support for the hypervisor to function correctly.\n\nThe open-source software (OSS) community plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of hypervisor modules. They contribute to the development of the hypervisor code, test and debug it, and provide support to users. This collaboration between the hypervisor developers and the OSS community ensures that the hypervisor modules are reliable and secure.\n\nIn summary, the hypervisor modules are installed on top of the OS, which acts as an interface between the hardware units and the hypervisor packages. The OSS community plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the hypervisor modules, ensuring their reliability and security.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
