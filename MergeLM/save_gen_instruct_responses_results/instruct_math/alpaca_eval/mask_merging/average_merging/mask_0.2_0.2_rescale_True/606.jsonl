Start by filling in the easy numbers. These are the numbers that are only possible in one or two cells in a row, column, or box.\n2. Once you've filled in all the easy numbers, move on to the more difficult numbers. These are the numbers that have more than one possible placement in a row, column, or box.\n3. Use the process of elimination to narrow down the possible placements for each number. Look for rows, columns, or boxes where a number can't go, and then eliminate that number from the other possibilities.\n4. Continue this process until all the numbers are filled in.\n\nGood luck!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
