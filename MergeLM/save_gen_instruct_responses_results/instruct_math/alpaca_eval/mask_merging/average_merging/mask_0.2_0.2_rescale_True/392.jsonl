Hearing damage: Prolonged exposure to loud music (70-75db) can cause permanent hearing damage, especially if you already have some hearing loss.\n2. Tinnitus: Loud music can cause tinnitus, a ringing or buzzing in the ears that can be temporary or permanent.\n3. Decreased concentration: Listening to loud music can make it difficult to concentrate on other sounds, including important announcements or instructions from teachers.\n4. Social isolation: If you always listen to loud music to block out the noise, you may become isolated from your peers and miss out on important social interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while listening to loud music may provide some temporary relief from the screaming kids at school, it's important to consider the potential long-term effects on your hearing and overall well-being.
