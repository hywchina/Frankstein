{"instruction": "I'm an English speaker trying to learn Japanese Kanji using mnemonics. Mnemonics for Kanji are created from the primitives that make them up. The Kanji for Tax has the primitives wheat and devil, so an example would be, \"Taxes are like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat\". Can you create a mnemonic for the Kanji meaning Wish that has the primitives clock and heart?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! The Kanji for \"wish\" is \u9858 (gan). It's composed of the radicals \u5fc3 (heart) and \u6642 (clock). Here's a mnemonic for you:\n\n\"A clock is like a heart that ticks away, but it can't grant your wishes. Only you can make your dreams come true.\"\n\nThis mnemonic uses the idea of a clock ticking away to represent the passing of time, which is a common theme in wishes. It also emphasizes the idea that wishes are something that only the person making the wish can fulfill, not something that can be given to them by others or found in objects.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
