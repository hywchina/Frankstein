{"instruction": "Implement a queue data structure using two stacks in Python.", "output": "To implement a queue data structure using two stacks in Python, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create two empty stacks, one for the front of the queue and one for the back of the queue.\n2. Define a method to enqueue an element, which pushes the element onto the back stack.\n3. Define a method to dequeue an element, which pops the front stack until it is empty, then moves the back stack to the front and returns the top element.\n4. Define a method to peek at the front of the queue, which returns the top element of the front stack without removing it.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Queue:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.front_stack = []\n        self.back_stack = []\n\n    def enqueue(self, element):\n        self.back_stack.append(element)\n\n    def dequeue(self):\n        while self.front_stack:\n            element = self.front_stack.pop()\n            self.back_stack.append(element)\n            return element\n\n    def peek(self):\n        return self.front_stack[-1] if self.front_stack else None\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two stacks to simulate a queue. The `enqueue` method appends an element to the back stack, and the `dequeue` method pops the front stack until it is empty, then moves the back stack to the front and returns the top element. The `peek` method returns the top element of the front stack without removing it.\n\nHere's an example of using the queue:\n\n```python\nqueue = Queue()\n\nqueue.enqueue(1)\nqueue.enqueue(2)\nqueue.enqueue(3)\n\nprint(queue.peek())  # 1\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # 1\nprint(queue.peek())  # 2\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # 2\nprint(queue.peek())  # 3\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # 3\nprint(queue.peek())  # None\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates how to use the queue to enqueue and dequeue elements, as well as peek at the front of the queue. Note that the queue is empty after all elements have been dequeued.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
