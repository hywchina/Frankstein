{"instruction": "Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.", "output": "Here's a simple C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    ifstream inputFile;\n    string line;\n    string wordToFind = \"your_word_here\";\n    int count = 0;\n\n    inputFile.open(\"your_file_here.txt\");\n\n    if (inputFile.is_open()) {\n        while (getline(inputFile, line)) {\n            if (line.find(wordToFind) != string::npos) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n        inputFile.close();\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Error opening file.\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    cout << \"The word \" << wordToFind << \" occurs \" << count << \" times in the file.\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo use this program, you would replace \"your_file_here.txt\" with the name of the text file you want to read, and \"your_word_here\" with the word you want to count occurrences of. Then, you would run the program and it would output the number of occurrences of the specified word in the file.\n\nNote that this program assumes that the text file is in the same directory as the program, or that you provide the full path to the file. If the file is in a different directory, you would need to provide the full path to the file.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
