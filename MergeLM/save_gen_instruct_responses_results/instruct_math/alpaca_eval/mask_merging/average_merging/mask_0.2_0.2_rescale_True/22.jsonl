{"instruction": "What type of soil is suitable for cactus?", "output": "Cacti are native to arid and semi-arid regions, so they prefer well-draining soil that is sandy or rocky in texture. The soil should be able to dry out quickly between waterings, as cacti do not like to sit in wet soil for extended periods of time. A mix of potting soil, sand, and perlite or pumice is a good choice for cactus plants. You can also add a small amount of compost or manure to the soil to provide additional nutrients, but be sure to use a very small amount as cacti do not require a lot of fertilizer.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
