{"instruction": "Marie is at the music store for a store day. She bought two $50 combos. Then, for $25 she bought two t-shirts for $5 each and five hoodies for $2 each. Then, she bought sneakers for $8 each. How much did she spend total?", "output": "First, we need to calculate the cost of the combos. Marie bought two combos, and each combo costs $50. So, the total cost of the combos is:\n\n2 combos * $50/combo = $100\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the t-shirts. Marie bought two t-shirts for $5 each. So, the total cost of the t-shirts is:\n\n2 t-shirts * $5/t-shirt = $10\n\nThen, we need to calculate the cost of the hoodies. Marie bought five hoodies for $2 each. So, the total cost of the hoodies is:\n\n5 hoodies * $2/hoodie = $10\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost of the sneakers. Marie bought one pair of sneakers for $8. So, the total cost of the sneakers is:\n\n1 pair of sneakers * $8/pair = $8\n\nFinally, we need to add up the cost of all the items to find the total amount Marie spent:\n\n$100 (combos) + $10 (t-shirts) + $10 (hoodies) + $8 (sneakers) = $128\n\nSo, Marie spent a total of $128 on her shopping spree.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
