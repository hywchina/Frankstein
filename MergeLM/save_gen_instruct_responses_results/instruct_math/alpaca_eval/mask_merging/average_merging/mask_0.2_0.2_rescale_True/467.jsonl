{"instruction": "What is the best way to form a new habit?", "output": "Forming a new habit can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some of the best ways to form a new habit:\n\n1. Start small: Choose a habit that is achievable and realistic for you. If you want to start exercising, for example, start with a short walk or a few push-ups instead of trying to run a marathon right away.\n\n2. Make it a routine: Habits are more likely to stick when they become part of your daily routine. Try to do your new habit at the same time every day, such as brushing your teeth or taking a shower.\n\n3. Use reminders: Set reminders for yourself to help you remember to do your new habit. This could be a post-it note on your fridge, an alarm on your phone, or a reminder app.\n\n4. Track your progress: Keep track of how often you do your new habit. This can help you stay motivated and see how far you've come. You can use a habit tracker app or simply write it down in a journal.\n\n5. Be patient: It takes time to form a new habit. Don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track and keep going.\n\n6. Find a buddy: Having someone to support you and hold you accountable can make it easier to form a new habit. Find a friend or family member who wants to form the same habit and encourage each other.\n\n7. Reward yourself: Give yourself a small reward when you reach a milestone or achieve your goal. This can help motivate you to continue the habit.\n\nRemember, forming a new habit takes time and effort, but with persistence and patience, you can make it a part of your daily routine.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
