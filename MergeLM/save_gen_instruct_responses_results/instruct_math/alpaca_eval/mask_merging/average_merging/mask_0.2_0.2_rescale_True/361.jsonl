{"instruction": "How to code the snake game in C that will be smooth and it will use images to animate whole level.", "output": "Creating a smooth snake game in C using images to animate the whole level is a complex task that requires a good understanding of game development and computer graphics. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this project:\n\n1. **Game Logic**: First, you need to define the game logic. This includes the rules of the game, such as how the snake moves, how it eats food, and how it grows. You'll also need to define the game's states, such as the main game loop, the game over state, and any other states that the game might transition to.\n\n2. **Graphics**: Next, you'll need to create the graphics for the game. This includes the snake, the food, and any other objects that appear in the game. You'll need to create these graphics as images and store them in your program.\n\n3. **Animation**: To make the game smooth, you'll need to create a system for animating the graphics. This might involve using a timer to update the game's state and redraw the screen at a regular interval. You'll also need to create a system for handling collisions between the snake and the food, as well as between the snake and the walls of the level.\n\n4. **User Input**: The player will need a way to control the snake. This might involve using the arrow keys to move the snake in different directions. You'll need to create a system for reading the user's input and updating the snake's position accordingly.\n\n5. **Level Design**: Finally, you'll need to create a level for the snake to play in. This might involve creating a grid of cells, each of which can either be empty or contain a piece of food. You'll need to create a system for generating random levels and for displaying the level to the player.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might implement some of these features in C:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <SDL.h>\n#include <SDL_image.h>\n\n#define WIDTH 640\n#define HEIGHT 480\n#define FOOD_SIZE 16\n#define SNAKE_SIZE 32\n#define SPEED 5\n\nSDL_Window *window;\nSDL_Renderer *renderer;\nSDL_Texture *snake_texture;\nSDL_Texture *food_texture;\nSDL_Texture *background_texture;\n\nSDL_Rect snake_rect;\nSDL_Rect food_rect;\nSDL_Rect background_rect;\n\nint score = 0;\nint direction = 0;\nint food_x = 0;\nint food_y = 0;\nint snake_x = 0;\nint snake_y = 0;\nint snake_length = 0;\n\nvoid init() {\n    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {\n        printf(\"SDL_Init failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    window = SDL_CreateWindow(\"Snake\", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, WIDTH, HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);\n    if (window == NULL) {\n        printf(\"SDL_CreateWindow failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        SDL_Quit();\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);\n    if (renderer == NULL) {\n        printf(\"SDL_CreateRenderer failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    background_rect.x = 0;\n    background_rect.y = 0;\n    background_rect.w = WIDTH;\n    background_rect.h = HEIGHT;\n\n    background_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 32, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000));\n    if (background_texture == NULL) {\n        printf(\"SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    snake_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, SNAKE_SIZE, SNAKE_SIZE, 32, 0x00ff0000, 0x0000ff00, 0x000000ff, 0x00000000));\n    if (snake_texture == NULL) {\n        printf(\"SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        SDL_DestroyTexture(background_texture);\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    food_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, FOOD_SIZE, FOOD_SIZE, 32, 0xffff0000, 0x0000ff00, 0x000000ff, 0x00000000));\n    if (food_texture == NULL) {\n        printf(\"SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface failed: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError());\n        SDL_DestroyTexture(snake_texture);\n        SDL_DestroyTexture(background_texture);\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        exit(1);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid cleanup() {\n    SDL_DestroyTexture(food_texture);\n    SDL_DestroyTexture(snake_texture);\n    SDL_DestroyTexture(background_texture);\n    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n    SDL_Quit();\n}\n\nvoid update_snake() {\n    snake_rect.x = snake_x;\n    snake_rect.y = snake_y;\n    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, snake_texture, NULL, &snake_rect);\n\n    if (direction == 0) {\n        snake_x--;\n    } else if (direction == 1) {\n        snake_x++;\n    } else if (direction == 2) {\n        snake_y--;\n    } else {\n        snake_y++;\n    }\n\n    snake_rect.x = snake_x;\n    snake_rect.y = snake_y;\n    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, snake_texture, NULL, &snake_rect);\n}\n\nvoid update_food() {\n    food_rect.x = food_x;\n    food_rect.y = food_y;\n    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, food_texture, NULL, &food_rect);\n}\n\nvoid handle_input() {\n    SDL_Event event;\n    while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {\n        if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {\n            cleanup();\n            exit(0);\n        } else if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {\n            switch (event.key.keysym.sym) {\n                case SDLK_UP:\n                    direction = 2;\n                    break;\n                case SDLK_DOWN:\n                    direction = 1;\n                    break;\n                case SDLK_LEFT:\n                    direction = 0;\n                    break;\n                case SDLK_RIGHT:\n                    direction = 3;\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid generate_level() {\n    // Generate", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
