{"instruction": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. What do they each have to spend?", "output": "First, we know that Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister. Let's represent the younger sister's weekly budget as \"x\". Therefore, Navina's weekly budget would be \"x + $30\".\n\nNext, we know that Navina can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. The cost of the credit card is not specified, but let's assume it's \"y\". So, Navina's total spending would be her weekly budget minus the cost of the credit card, which is \"(x + $30) - y\".\n\nSince Navina's budget is more than her sister's, and she can still afford the credit card, we can conclude that the cost of the credit card is within both of their budgets. Therefore, we can say that \"y\" is less than or equal to both \"x\" and \"x + $30\".\n\nNow, we need to find out how much each sister has to spend. We know that Navina's total spending is \"(x + $30) - y\", and her sister's total spending is just \"x\". So, we can write the equation:\n\n(x + $30) - y = x\n\nTo solve for \"x\", we can first add \"y\" to both sides of the equation:\n\nx + $30 - y + y = x + y\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + $30 = x + y\n\nNow, we can subtract \"x\" from both sides of the equation:\n\n$30 = y\n\nSo, the cost of the credit card is $30.\n\nFinally, we can find out how much each sister has to spend by subtracting the cost of the credit card from their respective budgets:\n\nNavina's spending: x + $30 - $30 = x\nYounger sister's spending: x - $30 = x\n\nSince \"x\" represents their weekly budget, both sisters have $0 left to spend after buying the credit card. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nEach sister has $0 to spend.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
