{"instruction": "does the dinosaurs really exist?", "output": "Yes, dinosaurs really existed. They were a group of reptiles that lived on Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 million to 66 million years ago. The first dinosaurs appeared about 230 million years ago, and the last dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence that supports the existence of dinosaurs, including fossils, tracks, and other traces they left behind. Fossils are the remains or traces of ancient organisms that have been preserved in the Earth's crust. Dinosaur fossils have been found on every continent on Earth, and they include bones, teeth, eggs, and even dinosaur dung.\n\nIn addition to fossils, there is also indirect evidence that supports the existence of dinosaurs. For example, the presence of certain types of plants and animals that lived at the same time as the dinosaurs suggests that the dinosaurs were real.\n\nSo, based on the evidence, it is clear that dinosaurs really existed and were a major part of Earth's history.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
