{"instruction": "Write an interesting and detailed backstory for my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder. The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "output": "Your character is a half-elf ranger named Eira. She was born in a small village on the edge of a dense forest, where her mother was the village healer and her father was a skilled hunter. Eira's parents were both killed in a tragic accident when she was just a child, leaving her an orphan.\n\nAfter their death, Eira was taken in by the village elder, a wise old man who taught her the ways of the forest and how to survive in the wilderness. He also taught her how to use a bow and arrow, and she quickly proved to be a natural with a weapon. As she grew older, Eira became the village's protector, using her skills as a ranger to keep the village safe from the dangers that lurked in the forest.\n\nHowever, Eira's life took a dark turn when she discovered that the village elder was not who he seemed. He was actually a powerful necromancer who had been using the village as a base to conduct his dark rituals. Eira confronted the elder and, in the ensuing battle, he was killed.\n\nAfter the elder's death, Eira found a mysterious artifact in his possession - a magical bow that seemed to have a will of its own. The bow chose Eira as its master, and she soon discovered that it granted her powerful abilities. With the bow's help, Eira was able to defeat the undead creatures that the elder had created and restore peace to the village.\n\nHowever, Eira knew that she could not stay in the village forever. She felt a calling to explore the wider world and use her skills as a ranger to protect the innocent from the dangers that lurked in the shadows. So, she set out on a journey to find her place in the world, armed with her magical bow and a determination to make a difference.\n\nEira's journey has taken her to many places, and she has faced many challenges along the way. She has battled dark cults, defeated powerful monsters, and saved innocent lives. But no matter where her journey takes her, Eira always carries the memory of her parents and the village that raised her, and she is determined to make them proud.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
