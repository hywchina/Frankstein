She lived a long and fulfilling life, touching the hearts of everyone she met with her kindness, generosity, and love.\n\nBorn in South Dakota, she was the youngest of 12 children. She grew up during the Great Depression, a time of hardship and struggle. But even in those difficult times, she learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of family.\n\nShe married twice, first at the age of 18, and then again at the age of 40. From her first marriage, she had 6 children, and from her second marriage, she had 4 more. In total, she had over 30 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren. She was a loving mother and grandmother, always putting the needs of her family first.\n\nShe was also a foster mother to many babies, providing them with a safe and loving home. She had a special bond with each of them, and they held a special place in her heart.\n\nShe loved to travel, and she had the opportunity to visit many places in her lifetime. She especially loved going to Hawaii, where she would watch the hummingbirds and enjoy the warm sunshine.\n\nThroughout her life, she faced many challenges and hardships, but she never lost her spirit or her sense of humor. She was a woman of great strength and resilience, and she inspired us all with her courage and determination.\n\nWe will miss her dearly, but we take comfort in knowing that she is at peace and free from pain. We will always remember her as a kind and caring woman, a loving mother and grandmother, and a true friend to all who knew her.\n\nRest in peace, grandma. You will be deeply missed, but your memory will live on in our hearts forever.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
