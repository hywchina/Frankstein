{"instruction": "Provide an example of how a table of contents can be generated automatically in a LATEX document. Make sure your example contains the necessary commands.", "output": "To generate a table of contents automatically in a LATEX document, you can use the `toc` package. Here's an example:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{toc}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\chapter{Introduction}\n\\section{First Section}\n\\subsection{First Subsection}\n\\section{Second Section}\n\\subsection{Second Subsection}\n\\section{Third Section}\n\\subsection{Third Subsection}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `toc` package is loaded at the beginning of the document. The `\\tableofcontents` command is then used to generate the table of contents. The table of contents will automatically be updated whenever a new chapter, section, or subsection is added to the document.\n\nNote that the `toc` package also supports generating a list of figures and a list of tables automatically. To do this, you would use the `\\listoffigures` and `\\listoftables` commands, respectively.\n\nThe generated table of contents will look like this:\n\n```\nCONTENTS\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. First Section\n1.1.1. First Subsection\n1.2. Second Section\n1.2.1. Second Subsection\n1.3. Third Section\n1.3.1. Third Subsection\n```\n\nYou can customize the appearance of the table of contents by adjusting the options provided by the `toc` package. For example, you can change the font size, the spacing between entries, and the number of levels of headings that are included in the table of contents.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
