{"instruction": "Please implement the Timsort algorithm on Lean 4 and explain your code", "output": "Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines elements of insertion sort and merge sort. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the order of equal elements is preserved. Here's a simple implementation of Timsort in Lean 4:\n\n```lean\ndef timsort (list : list (list A)) : list A :=\n  match list with\n  | nil => nil\n  | cons (x, xs) =>\n    let\n      sorted_sublists := timsort (map (cons x) xs)\n      -- We need to reverse the sorted sublists to get the final sorted list\n      -- because the merge sort step in Timsort merges from right to left\n      sorted_sublists_rev := map (cons x) sorted_sublists\n      -- Merge the sorted sublists back into one list\n      merged_list := merge sorted_sublists_rev\n    in\n      merged_list\n  end\n\ndef merge (list1 : list A, list2 : list A) : list A :=\n  match list1, list2 with\n  | nil, _ => list2\n  | _, nil => list1\n  | head1, head2 =>\n    if head1 < head2 then\n      cons head1 (merge list1 (tail list2))\n    else\n      cons head2 (merge list2 (tail list1))\n  end\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the basic structure of the Timsort algorithm:\n\n1. Divide the input list into sublists, where each sublist has a single element as the head and the rest of the list as the tail.\n2. Sort each sublist using insertion sort or another sorting algorithm.\n3. Merge the sorted sublists back into one list using merge sort.\n\nThe `timsort` function takes a list of lists as input and returns a sorted list. The `merge` function takes two sorted lists and merges them into one sorted list.\n\nPlease note that this implementation is not optimized for performance and is provided for educational purposes only. In a real-world application, you would want to use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as merge sort or quick sort.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
