{"instruction": "Write a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts.", "output": "1. Understand the conflict: When you encounter a merge conflict, it means that there are differences between the code in the branch you are merging and the code in the branch you are merging into. These differences can be in the form of added, deleted, or modified lines of code.\n\n2. Identify the conflicting files: GitHub will highlight the files that have conflicts. You can see these files in the \"Merge conflicts\" tab in the pull request.\n\n3. Open the conflicting file: Click on the file to open it in the editor. You will see the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>) indicating the changes that need to be resolved.\n\n4. Resolve the conflict: You have three options to resolve the conflict:\n\n   a. Accept the changes from the branch you are merging into: Delete the code between the \"========\" markers and keep the code before and after the markers.\n\n   b. Accept the changes from the branch you are merging: Delete the code between the \"<<<<<<<\" and \"========\" markers, and keep the code after the \"========\" markers.\n\n   c. Accept the changes from the branch you are merging into and the branch you are merging: Keep the code between the \"<<<<<<<\" and \"========\" markers, and delete the code after the \"========\" markers.\n\n5. Commit the changes: After resolving the conflict, commit the changes. In the commit message, mention that you resolved a merge conflict.\n\n6. Push the changes: Push the changes to the branch.\n\n7. Merge the branch: Once the conflict is resolved, you can merge the branch. GitHub will automatically detect the resolved conflict and complete the merge.\n\n8. Close the pull request: After the merge is successful, you can close the pull request.\n\nRemember, it's important to understand the changes in the conflicting files before resolving the conflict. This will help you make the right decision and avoid introducing new bugs or errors.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
