{"instruction": "Hi. I want to make an embossed picture for my blind girlfriend. There is a Braille printer at my university that I can use. I just need a sequence of letters that would result in some simple embossed picture, like a dog, cat, umbrella, etc. Can you give me a such text?", "output": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some simple embossed pictures you can create using a Braille printer:\n\n1. Dog:\n   - Start with the letter \"D\" (\u2801) to represent the head of the dog.\n   - Use the letter \"O\" (\u2817) to represent the body of the dog.\n   - Use the letter \"G\" (\u2805) to represent the tail of the dog.\n   - You can also use the letter \"L\" (\u2817) to represent the ears of the dog.\n\n2. Cat:\n   - Start with the letter \"C\" (\u2801) to represent the head of the cat.\n   - Use the letter \"A\" (\u2820) to represent the body of the cat.\n   - Use the letter \"T\" (\u2832) to represent the tail of the cat.\n   - You can also use the letter \"I\" (\u2810) to represent the ears of the cat.\n\n3. Umbrella:\n   - Start with the letter \"U\" (\u2816) to represent the handle of the umbrella.\n   - Use the letter \"M\" (\u2818) to represent the main part of the umbrella.\n   - Use the letter \"B\" (\u2805) to represent the bottom of the umbrella.\n   - You can also use the letter \"R\" (\u2817) to represent the ribs of the umbrella.\n\n4. Tree:\n   - Start with the letter \"T\" (\u2832) to represent the trunk of the tree.\n   - Use the letter \"R\" (\u2817) to represent the branches of the tree.\n   - Use the letter \"E\" (\u2804) to represent the leaves of the tree.\n\n5. Sun:\n   - Start with the letter \"S\" (\u2805) to represent the sun.\n   - Use the letter \"U\" (\u2816) to represent the rays of the sun.\n\n6. Heart:\n   - Start with the letter \"H\" (\u2801) to represent the top of the heart.\n   - Use the letter \"E\" (\u2804) to represent the bottom of the heart.\n   - Use the letter \"A\" (\u2820) to represent the left side of the heart.\n   - Use the letter \"R\" (\u2817) to represent the right side of the heart.\n\nRemember that these are just simple examples, and you can create more complex pictures by combining these basic shapes. Also, keep in mind that the size of the embossed picture will depend on the size of the Braille cells on the paper you are using.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
