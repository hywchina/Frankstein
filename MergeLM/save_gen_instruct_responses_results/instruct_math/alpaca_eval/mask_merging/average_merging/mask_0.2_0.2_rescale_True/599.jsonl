{"instruction": "Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.", "output": "In German, verbs can be divided into two main groups: strong verbs and weak verbs. The way you end a German verb depends on which group it belongs to.\n\n1. Strong Verbs: Strong verbs are those that form their past tense by adding a prefix to the root of the verb. The prefixes are \"ge-\" for the past tense and \"t-\" for the past participle. For example, the verb \"laufen\" (to run) is a strong verb. Its past tense is \"gegangen\" and its past participle is \"gelaufen\".\n\n2. Weak Verbs: Weak verbs are those that form their past tense and past participle by adding a suffix to the root of the verb. The suffixes are \"-te\" for the past tense and \"-en\" for the past participle. For example, the verb \"sein\" (to be) is a weak verb. Its past tense is \"war\" and its past participle is \"gewesen\".\n\nSo, to end a German verb, you need to know whether it is a strong verb or a weak verb and then apply the appropriate ending.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
