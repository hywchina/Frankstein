{"instruction": "You need to write an email to negotiate your salary.", "output": "Subject: Request for Salary Negotiation\n\nDear [Employer's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss my current salary and to request a review.\n\nI have been working at [Company Name] for [Number of Years] years now, and I have been thoroughly enjoying my time here. I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I have gained during my tenure.\n\nHowever, I believe that my current salary does not accurately reflect my contributions to the company. I have taken on additional responsibilities and have consistently exceeded my performance targets. I believe that my hard work and dedication warrant a salary increase.\n\nI have done some research on the market and I found that my current salary is below the average for someone with my experience and qualifications in this field. I would like to request a salary review to bring my compensation in line with industry standards.\n\nI understand that the company may have budget constraints, and I am willing to negotiate and discuss possible options. I am open to a performance-based salary increase or a one-time adjustment, depending on what works best for the company.\n\nI would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you. Please let me know a convenient time for us to meet.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
