Find this reference.", "output": "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with a specific legal reference for the case you mentioned. However, I can provide you with some general information about the history of marijuana and its legal status in the United States.\n\nMarijuana, also known as cannabis, has been used for medicinal and recreational purposes for thousands of years. In the United States, it was first banned in the early 20th century as part of a campaign led by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) and its director, Harry J. Anslinger.\n\nAnslinger and the FBN claimed that marijuana was a dangerous drug that led to crime, violence, and moral decay. They used sensationalized stories and exaggerated claims to push for its prohibition. One of the most famous examples of this was the \"Assassin of Youth\" campaign, which claimed that marijuana caused people to commit violent crimes.\n\nHowever, many of these claims were later found to be false or exaggerated. For example, the FBN's claims about the dangers of marijuana were based on a single case in which a man killed his family while under the influence of cannabis. But it was later revealed that the man also had a history of mental illness and had been drinking alcohol at the time of the murders.\n\nDespite these revelations, marijuana remained illegal in the United States for many years. It wasn't until the 1990s that the first states began to legalize medical marijuana, and it wasn't until 2012 that Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nToday, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level in the United States, but it is legal for medical or recreational use in 33 states and the District of Columbia. The legal status of marijuana continues to be a topic of debate and controversy, with many people arguing for its full legalization and others opposing it.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
