{"instruction": "I'm trying to draw out a hopscotch game on my driveway. Can you walk me through how to do that?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you draw out a hopscotch game on your driveway. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, you need to decide on the size of your hopscotch court. The standard size for a hopscotch court is 8 feet by 8 feet, but you can adjust the size to fit your driveway.\n\n2. Once you've decided on the size, use chalk to draw a square on your driveway. Make sure the square is the size you decided on in step 1.\n\n3. Inside the square, draw a series of numbered squares. The number of squares depends on the size of your court. For an 8x8 court, you would have 16 squares. The squares should be numbered from 1 to 9, and then from 1 to 9 again, forming a grid.\n\n4. Connect the squares with lines to form the hopscotch court. The lines should be diagonal, forming a pattern that looks like a series of triangles.\n\n5. At the top of the court, draw a larger square with a number in it. This is the \"starting square.\"\n\n6. At the bottom of the court, draw a larger square with a different number in it. This is the \"ending square.\"\n\n7. Finally, draw a line connecting the starting square to the ending square. This is the \"hopscotch path.\"\n\nNow you have a complete hopscotch court! To play, one player stands in the starting square and tosses a small object (like a stone or a beanbag) into the first square. They then hop through the court, landing in each square in order, and pick up the object on the way back. If they successfully complete the course without stepping on a line or missing a square, they win. If they make a mistake, their turn is over and the next player goes.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
