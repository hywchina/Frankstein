{"instruction": "I heard something about a number of British folks being deceived into believing that spaghetti grows on trees. Is this real? If so, how were they able to be drawn into a deception like this?", "output": "Yes, the story you're referring to is real. It's known as the \"Spaghetti Tree Hoax\" and it was a prank that was broadcast on April Fool's Day in 1957 by the BBC.\n\nThe hoax was a segment on the BBC's Panorama current affairs program, which showed footage of a family in Ticino, Switzerland, harvesting spaghetti from trees in their garden. The narrator explained that the spaghetti was the result of a mild winter and a new variety of spaghetti tree.\n\nThe hoax was successful because it played on the public's lack of knowledge about how pasta is made. Many people believed that spaghetti could be grown on trees, and the BBC received numerous calls from viewers asking how they could grow their own spaghetti trees.\n\nThe hoax is often cited as an example of how easily people can be deceived by the media, especially when they don't have the necessary knowledge or context to question what they're seeing or hearing.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
