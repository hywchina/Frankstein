{"instruction": "I am making mayonnaise, it was starting to thicken but now it has become runny and liquid again, is there any way to salvage it?", "output": "Yes, there are a few things you can try to salvage your runny mayonnaise:\n\n1. Add more oil: If your mayonnaise has become too thin, you can try adding more oil to it. Start by adding a teaspoon of oil at a time and whisking the mixture until it thickens. Continue this process until you reach the desired consistency.\n\n2. Add more egg yolk: If you think your mayonnaise might not have enough egg yolk, you can try adding another yolk. Make sure to whisk the mixture thoroughly after adding the new yolk.\n\n3. Add a thickener: You can try adding a thickener like cornstarch or arrowroot powder to your mayonnaise. Mix a small amount of the thickener with a little water to form a paste, then add it to your mayonnaise and whisk until it thickens.\n\n4. Refrigerate it: If all else fails, you can try refrigerating your mayonnaise for a few hours. The cold temperature will help it thicken up.\n\nRemember, when making mayonnaise, it's important to add the oil slowly and whisk constantly to ensure it thickens properly. If you add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise will become runny.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
