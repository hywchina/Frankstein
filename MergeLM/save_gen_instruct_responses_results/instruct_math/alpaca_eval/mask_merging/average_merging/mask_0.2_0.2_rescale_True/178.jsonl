{"instruction": "Is online casino legal in India?", "output": "Yes, online casinos are legal in India. However, the legality of online gambling in India is a complex issue due to the country's diverse laws and regulations.\n\nThe Public Gambling Act of 1867 is the primary law that governs gambling in India. This law prohibits running or being in charge of a public gambling house. However, it does not specifically address online gambling.\n\nIn 2000, the Information Technology Act was passed, which includes a provision that makes it illegal to publish or transmit information that is \"grossly offensive or has a menacing character.\" This could potentially be interpreted to include online gambling.\n\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court of India ruled that online gambling is not illegal under the Public Gambling Act, as long as it is played between individuals and does not involve a public gambling house. However, individual states have the power to pass their own laws regarding gambling, and some have done so.\n\nFor example, the state of Maharashtra has a law that prohibits online gambling, while the state of Goa has legalized it. Additionally, the state of Sikkim has passed a law that allows for online gambling within its borders.\n\nIn summary, while online casinos are not explicitly illegal in India, the legality of online gambling can vary depending on the state and the specific laws in place. It is important to check the laws in your state before engaging in online gambling.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
