{"instruction": "if it takes 8 hours to fly to Singapore, stop over for an hour and a half and then fly 14 hours to London then what is the total travel time if the plane is delayed in Singapore", "output": "First, we need to determine the total flight time from Singapore to London. We know that it takes 8 hours to fly from Singapore to London, and there is a stopover in Singapore for 1.5 hours. So, the total flight time from Singapore to London is:\n\n8 hours (flight from Singapore to London) + 1.5 hours (stopover in Singapore) = 9.5 hours\n\nNow, let's consider the delay in Singapore. If the plane is delayed, the total travel time will increase. We don't have information about the duration of the delay, so let's denote it as \"x\" hours.\n\nThe total travel time with the delay in Singapore will be:\n\n9.5 hours (flight time from Singapore to London) + x hours (delay in Singapore)\n\nSo, the total travel time with the delay in Singapore will be:\n\n9.5 hours + x hours\n\nTherefore, the total travel time with the delay in Singapore is dependent on the duration of the delay. Without knowing the duration of the delay, we cannot provide a specific total travel time.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
