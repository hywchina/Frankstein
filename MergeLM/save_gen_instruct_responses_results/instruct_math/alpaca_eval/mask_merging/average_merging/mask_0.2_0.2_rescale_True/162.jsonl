BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe sun is shining brightly over the turquoise waters of Miami Beach. The camera pans across the beach, showing the palm trees swaying in the breeze and the beachgoers soaking up the sun.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe camera enters the club, which is packed with people dancing and enjoying themselves. The DJ is spinning some upbeat tunes, and the bar is bustling with activity.\n\nWe see JdeG, a tall, lanky man with a shaved head and a goatee, working the bar. He's wearing a white tank top and a pair of board shorts, and he's mixing drinks with precision.\n\nSophieSnazz, a blonde, bubbly woman with a British accent, is working the other side of the bar. She's wearing a tight, red tank top and a pair of denim shorts, and she's chatting with a group of customers.\n\nAs the camera moves around the bar, we see Beefy, the club's owner, standing at the entrance, greeting customers and collecting cover charges. He's a burly, tattooed man with a shaved head and a thick British accent.\n\nSuddenly, a fight breaks out at the bar. A group of rowdy customers are arguing with JdeG over the price of their drinks. SophieSnazz tries to intervene, but the situation quickly escalates.\n\nBeefy rushes over to the bar, trying to break up the fight. He grabs one of the customers by the collar and slams him against the wall.\n\n\"That's enough!\" Beefy yells. \"You're all out of here!\"\n\nThe customers start to leave, but not before one of them spits in JdeG's face. JdeG wipes it off and glares at the customer as he walks out.\n\nSophieSnazz turns to Beefy and rolls her eyes. \"Another day at Beefy's Beach Club,\" she says.\n\nBeefy chuckles and pats her on the shoulder. \"Don't worry, love. It's all part of the fun.\"\n\nThe camera zooms out as the music starts up again, and the party continues.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nThe end.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
