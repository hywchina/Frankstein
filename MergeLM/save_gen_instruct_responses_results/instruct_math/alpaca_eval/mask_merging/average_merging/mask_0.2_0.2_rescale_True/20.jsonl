{"instruction": "Help me find a good rated electric saw.", "output": "When looking for a good rated electric saw, there are several factors to consider. Here are some tips to help you find the best one for your needs:\n\n1. Determine the type of saw you need: There are different types of electric saws available, such as circular saws, jigsaws, reciprocating saws, and miter saws. Each type is designed for specific tasks, so it's important to choose the one that best suits your needs.\n\n2. Consider the power: The power of the saw is measured in amps (A). A higher amp rating means the saw can handle tougher materials and cut faster. However, a higher amp rating also means the saw will be heavier and more expensive.\n\n3. Look at the blade size: The blade size of the saw determines the thickness of the material it can cut. Make sure the blade size is appropriate for the materials you plan to cut.\n\n4. Check the safety features: Look for saws with safety features such as a blade guard, anti-kickback pawls, and a lock-off switch. These features can help prevent accidents and injuries.\n\n5. Read reviews: Check online reviews from other users to get an idea of the saw's performance, durability, and ease of use.\n\n6. Compare prices: Compare the prices of different saws to find the best value for your money. Keep in mind that a higher price doesn't always mean a better saw.\n\n7. Consider the warranty: Look for saws with a good warranty that covers parts and labor for a reasonable period of time.\n\nBased on these factors, some good rated electric saws include:\n\n- DEWALT DWE7491RS 10-Inch Table Saw with Rolling Stand\n- Makita LS1040 10-Inch Dual Slide Compound Miter Saw\n- Milwaukee 6391-21 12-Inch Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw\n- Bosch GCB10-5 10-Inch 5-Amp Corded Jigsaw\n- DEWALT DCS380B 20-Volt MAX Lithium Ion Reciprocating Saw\n\nRemember to always follow safety precautions when using an electric saw.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
