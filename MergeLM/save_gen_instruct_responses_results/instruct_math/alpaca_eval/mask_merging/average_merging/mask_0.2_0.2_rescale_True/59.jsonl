{"instruction": "I've read the book \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius, a few times. I'm curious about the context, of when he wrote.", "output": "Suetonius, whose full name was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, was a Roman historian and biographer who lived from approximately 69 AD to 122 AD. He is best known for his work \"The Twelve Caesars,\" which is a collection of biographies of the first twelve Roman emperors.\n\nSuetonius was born in the city of Nagidos in Africa, which is now known as Suffetula, Tunisia. He was a member of the equestrian class, which was the second highest social class in ancient Rome. He served in various government positions, including as a secretary to the emperor Hadrian.\n\nSuetonius wrote \"The Twelve Caesars\" during the reign of the emperor Hadrian, who ruled from 117 AD to 138 AD. The book was likely written between 119 AD and 122 AD, as Suetonius mentions Hadrian's death in the preface.\n\nThe book is a valuable source of information about the early Roman Empire, as it provides detailed accounts of the lives of the first twelve emperors, from Julius Caesar to Domitian. It includes information about their personal lives, their reigns, and their legacies.\n\nSuetonius's other works include \"The Lives of the Grammarians\" and \"The Lives of the Poets.\" He is considered one of the most important Roman historians and biographers of the 2nd century AD.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
