{"instruction": "why the sky is blue?", "output": "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This is a process where sunlight, which is made up of different colors, is scattered in different directions by the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is made up of gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen, and tiny particles like dust and water droplets. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters these particles. The shorter wavelength colors, like blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelength colors, like red and orange.\n\nThis is because the particles in the atmosphere are smaller than the wavelength of blue light, so they can easily scatter the blue light in all directions. The blue light is scattered in so many directions that when we look up at the sky, we see it coming from all directions, giving the sky its blue color.\n\nThe other colors, like red and orange, have longer wavelengths and are not scattered as much. They travel straight through the atmosphere and reach our eyes, giving the sun and other objects their color.\n\nSo, the sky appears blue because the blue light is scattered in all directions by the Earth's atmosphere, while the other colors are not scattered as much and travel straight to our eyes.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
