{"instruction": "I have two remote Debian servers, A and B. How can I copy a directory of files at `~/Documents/training_results` existing on server A to the path `~/training_results` on server B?

Since you have SSH access to both servers from your local laptop, you can use the following command to copy the directory:\n\n```\nrsync -avz --delete ~/Documents/training_results/ user@serverB:~/training_results/\n```\n\nHere's what each option does:\n\n- `rsync`: This is the command-line utility that performs the file transfer.\n- `-a`: This option tells `rsync` to copy all files, including hidden files and directories.\n- `-v`: This option enables verbose mode, which means `rsync` will provide detailed information about what it's doing.\n- `-z`: This option enables compression, which can speed up the transfer process.\n- `--delete`: This option tells `rsync` to delete files on the destination that no longer exist on the source.\n- `user@serverB`: This is the username and hostname of the server you want to copy the files to.\n- `~/training_results/`: This is the path to the directory you want to copy on the destination server.\n\nAfter running this command, you should see the contents of the `~/Documents/training_results` directory on server A being copied to the `~/training_results` directory on server B.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
