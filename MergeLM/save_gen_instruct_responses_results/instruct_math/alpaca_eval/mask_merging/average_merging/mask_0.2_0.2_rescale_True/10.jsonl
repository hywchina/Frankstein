{"instruction": "do you think retinoid is effective on removing the acne? because I have a lot of it", "output": "Yes, retinoids are effective in treating acne. They are derived from vitamin A and are used to unclog pores and reduce inflammation. They can help prevent new acne from forming and can also help to reduce the appearance of existing acne. However, it's important to note that retinoids can be irritating to the skin, so it's best to start with a low concentration and gradually increase as your skin becomes more tolerant. It's also important to use sunscreen during the day as retinoids can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
