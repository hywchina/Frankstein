{"instruction": "is queue an ADT or a data structure", "output": "A queue is a data structure, not an ADT (Abstract Data Type). An ADT is a conceptual model for organizing and manipulating data, while a data structure is a specific way of organizing and manipulating data in a computer program.\n\nA queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in computer science to manage tasks, events, or data in a system.\n\nIn programming, a queue can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or more advanced data structures like priority queues or circular buffers. The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as performance, memory usage, or complexity of operations.\n\nIn summary, a queue is a data structure used to store and retrieve elements in a specific order, and it is not an ADT.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
