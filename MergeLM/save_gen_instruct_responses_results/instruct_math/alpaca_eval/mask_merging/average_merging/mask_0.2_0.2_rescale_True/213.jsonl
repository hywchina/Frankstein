{"instruction": "what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot", "output": "The recommended pattern for creating games in Godot is to use the Scene-based architecture. This pattern involves creating a hierarchy of scenes, where each scene represents a different level, screen, or state in the game.\n\nHere's a general outline of the Scene-based architecture:\n\n1. Create a root scene: This is the main scene that contains all other scenes in the game. It's responsible for managing the game state and switching between scenes.\n2. Create scene nodes: These are nodes that contain the game logic and assets for each scene. You can have multiple scene nodes for different levels, screens, or states in the game.\n3. Connect scene nodes to the root scene: Use the `connect(\"scene_changed\", root, \"change_scene\")` method to connect each scene node to the root scene. This will allow the root scene to switch between scenes when the appropriate signal is emitted.\n4. Implement the `change_scene()` method in the root scene: This method should contain the logic for switching between scenes. It should take the new scene as an argument and remove the old scene from the scene tree.\n5. Use the `get_tree().change_scene(scene_path)` method to switch between scenes: This method will load the specified scene and remove the current scene from the scene tree.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can create a modular and reusable game architecture that makes it easy to add new levels, screens, and states to your game.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
