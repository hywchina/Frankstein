Pressing ESC will quit the game. The FPS counter will update every frame and will be limited to 60 FPS.\n\nThe code first initializes PyGame and sets the screen size and title. It then sets the FPS counter font, color, and position. The ESC key is set as the key for quitting the game. The FPS limit is set to 60.\n\nThe game loop starts and runs until the user presses ESC. In the loop, it handles events, updates the FPS counter, and updates the screen. The FPS counter is updated by getting the FPS from the clock object and rendering it on the screen using the FPS font. The screen is updated by blitting the FPS text to the correct position.\n\nThe FPS limit is achieved by using the `tick` method of the clock object, which limits the number of times the loop runs per second.\n\nFinally, PyGame is quit when the game is over.\n\nThis is a basic project in PyGame that includes keyboard event handling and FPS counter. You can build upon this code to create more complex games.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
