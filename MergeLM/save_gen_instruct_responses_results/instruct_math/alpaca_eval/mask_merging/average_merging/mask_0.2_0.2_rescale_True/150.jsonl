{"instruction": "Mick pays his teacher $800 for 40 lessons worth 2 hours each. If this will be all he is going to pay for his lessons, how much did he receive?", "output": "First, we need to determine the total number of hours Mick received in his lessons. Since each lesson is 2 hours long and he had 40 lessons, we can calculate the total hours as follows:\n\nTotal hours = Number of lessons * Hours per lesson\nTotal hours = 40 * 2\nTotal hours = 80\n\nNow that we know Mick received 80 hours of lessons, we can calculate the cost per hour. To do this, we will divide the total amount he paid by the total number of hours he received:\n\nCost per hour = Total amount paid / Total hours\nCost per hour = $800 / 80\nCost per hour = $10\n\nSo, Mick received $10 worth of lessons per hour. Since he received 80 hours of lessons, we can now calculate the total value of his lessons by multiplying the cost per hour by the total hours:\n\nTotal value = Cost per hour * Total hours\nTotal value = $10 * 80\nTotal value = $800\n\nTherefore, Mick received a total value of $800 worth of lessons.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
