{"instruction": "What is a scary Halloween costume idea?", "output": "A scary Halloween costume idea could be a zombie. You can dress up in torn and bloody clothes, apply fake blood and wounds, and add some fake maggots or worms to your hair or face to make it look more realistic. Another idea could be a werewolf. You can wear a full-body fur suit and add some fake fangs and claws to complete the look. For a more classic horror movie character, you could dress up as Michael Myers from the Halloween franchise. All you need is a white mask and a simple jumpsuit. If you want to be more original, you could create your own monster by combining different elements from different creatures, such as a vampire with a werewolf or a zombie with a mummy. The possibilities are endless!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
