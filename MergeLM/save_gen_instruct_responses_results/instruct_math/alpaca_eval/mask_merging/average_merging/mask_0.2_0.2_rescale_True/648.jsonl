{"instruction": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models", "output": "The dominant sequence transduction models are the models that are widely used and considered the best in the field of sequence transduction. These models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input sequence and transforms it into a fixed-length vector representation, while the decoder generates the output sequence based on this representation. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism, which allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sequence while generating the output.\n\nThe paper proposes a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms. This means that the Transformer does not use recurrence or convolutions, which are the two main components of the dominant sequence transduction models. The Transformer is designed to be more parallelizable and requires significantly less time to train compared to the dominant models.\n\nThe paper presents two main contributions:\n\n1. The Transformer model, which is a new architecture for sequence transduction that uses only attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrence and convolutions.\n2. The experimental results on two machine translation tasks, which show that the Transformer models are superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.\n\nThe paper achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, which is an improvement over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, the paper establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs. This is a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art, and it demonstrates the effectiveness of the Transformer model on a more challenging task.\n\nFinally, the paper shows that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. This demonstrates the versatility of the Transformer model and its potential for a wide range of sequence transduction tasks.\n\nIn summary, the paper proposes a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrence and convolutions. The experimental results on two machine translation tasks and English constituency parsing demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the Transformer model.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
