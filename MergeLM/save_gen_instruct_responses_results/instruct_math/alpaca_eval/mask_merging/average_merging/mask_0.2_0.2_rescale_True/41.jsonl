{"instruction": "How can I  use my phone less?", "output": "Here are some tips to help you use your phone less:\n\n1. Set a specific time limit: Decide on a specific time limit for using your phone each day and stick to it. You can use apps like Moment or Screen Time to track your phone usage and set daily limits.\n2. Keep your phone out of reach: Place your phone in a different room or keep it out of reach when you're not using it. This will make it harder to mindlessly pick up your phone and scroll through social media or other apps.\n3. Turn off notifications: Turn off notifications for non-essential apps or set them to silent. This will reduce the number of times you check your phone throughout the day.\n4. Use apps that help you disconnect: There are several apps available that can help you disconnect from your phone, such as Forest, which grows a tree every time you stay off your phone, or Freedom, which blocks distracting apps for a set period of time.\n5. Find alternative activities: Replace phone usage with other activities, such as reading a book, going for a walk, or spending time with friends and family.\n6. Set specific times for phone use: Designate specific times during the day when you can use your phone, such as during your lunch break or after dinner.\n7. Practice mindfulness: Be mindful of your phone usage and ask yourself if you really need to use your phone at that moment. If not, put it away and focus on the present moment.\n\nRemember, it's important to set realistic goals and be patient with yourself as you work to reduce your phone usage. It may take time to break the habit, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can use your phone less and live a more balanced life.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
