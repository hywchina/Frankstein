{"instruction": "Give me some impression of what the world was like in 1950. What were the current-day inventions back then?", "output": "In 1950, the world was a very different place compared to today. The post-World War II era was a time of recovery and growth, with many countries rebuilding their economies and societies. Here are some of the inventions and innovations that were current-day in 1950:\n\n1. Television: Television was still a relatively new invention in 1950. Color television was not yet widely available, and most people watched black and white TV programs.\n\n2. Computers: The first electronic computers were developed in the 1940s, and by 1950, they were being used for various purposes, such as scientific calculations and business applications. However, they were large and expensive, and not yet widely available for personal use.\n\n3. Nuclear Power: The first nuclear power plant was built in 1951, but the technology was already being developed in 1950. Nuclear power was seen as a promising source of energy for the future.\n\n4. Antibiotics: Antibiotics were first discovered in the 1940s, and by 1950, they were widely used to treat bacterial infections. Penicillin was the most well-known antibiotic at the time.\n\n5. Jet Airplanes: The first commercial jet airplane, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952, but the technology was already being developed in 1950. Jet airplanes were faster and more efficient than propeller-driven planes.\n\n6. Credit Cards: The first credit card, the Diners Club card, was introduced in 1950. It allowed people to pay for purchases without cash and was accepted at a limited number of restaurants and stores.\n\n7. Microwave Ovens: The first microwave oven was invented in 1947, but it was not widely available until the 1950s. Microwave ovens cooked food faster than conventional ovens and were popular for reheating leftovers.\n\n8. Polio Vaccine: The polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk, but the first vaccine trials were conducted in 1950. The vaccine was a major breakthrough in the fight against polio, a disease that had affected many children in the past.\n\n9. Video Games: The first video game, called \"Tennis for Two,\" was invented in 1958, but the concept of video games was already being developed in 1950. The game was played on an oscilloscope and used a simple controller to move a dot around the screen.\n\n10. Satellites: The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, but the technology was already being developed in 1950. Satellites were used for communication, weather forecasting, and other purposes.\n\nThese are just a few of the inventions and innovations that were current-day in 1950. The world was changing rapidly, and many of the technologies we take for granted today were just beginning to be developed.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
