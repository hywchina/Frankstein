{"instruction": "I've recently started playing the turn-based strategy game Into the Breach. I have read online that the game is considered to have 'perfect information'. What is meant by 'perfect information' in this context?", "output": "In the context of turn-based strategy games like Into the Breach, \"perfect information\" refers to the fact that all players have complete knowledge of the game state at all times. This means that each player knows the exact position and status of all units and structures on the map, as well as the resources and abilities available to them.\n\nIn a game with perfect information, there are no hidden elements or unknown variables that could affect the outcome of the game. Each player has access to the same information, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the current state of the game.\n\nIn contrast, some games, particularly real-time strategy games, do not have perfect information because the game state can change rapidly and some information may not be immediately available to all players. This can lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience, as players must make decisions based on incomplete information.\n\nIn Into the Breach, since it is a turn-based game, players have time to consider their moves and plan their strategy based on the current game state. This makes it a game with perfect information, as all players have access to the same information and can make informed decisions based on that information.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
