Let's start by looking at the available time slots for each person:\n\nPerson1: 9-11 am\nPerson2: 1-3 pm\nPerson3: 2-3:30 pm\n\nNow, let's try to find a time that works for all three people. We can see that Person1 is available in the morning, Person2 is available in the afternoon, and Person3 is available in the late afternoon. \n\nOne possible solution is to schedule the meetings back-to-back. This way, we can make the most of everyone's availability. Here's a possible schedule:\n\n1. Meeting with Person1 from 9-9:30 am (30 minutes)\n2. Meeting with Person2 from 10-11:30 am (90 minutes)\n3. Meeting with Person3 from 12:30-1:30 pm (60 minutes)\n\nThis schedule allows us to meet with all three people within the available time slots. The total meeting duration is 3 hours (90 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 180 minutes).\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible solution. Depending on the specific needs and preferences of the people involved, there may be other scheduling options that work better.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
