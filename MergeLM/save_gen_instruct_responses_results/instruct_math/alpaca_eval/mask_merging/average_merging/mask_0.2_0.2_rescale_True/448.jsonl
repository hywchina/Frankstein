{"instruction": "Suppose I have 12 eggs. I drop 2 and eat 5. How many eggs do I have left?", "output": "First, we need to determine how many eggs you have left after dropping 2 of them. To do this, we subtract the number of dropped eggs from the total number of eggs you initially had:\n\n12 (total eggs) - 2 (dropped eggs) = 10 eggs remaining\n\nNext, we need to account for the eggs you ate. You ate 5 eggs, so we subtract that number from the remaining eggs:\n\n10 (remaining eggs) - 5 (eaten eggs) = 5 eggs remaining\n\nSo, after dropping 2 eggs and eating 5 eggs, you have 5 eggs left. The final answer is: 5.\n\nThe answer is: 5.\n\n", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
