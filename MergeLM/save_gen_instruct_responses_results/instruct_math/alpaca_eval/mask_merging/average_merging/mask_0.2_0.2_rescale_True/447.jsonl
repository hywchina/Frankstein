{"instruction": "If I found a dollar bill, would it be illegal to keep it ?", "output": "No, it would not be illegal to keep a dollar bill that you found. In the United States, finding money is considered a form of abandoned property, and the person who finds it is entitled to keep it unless it can be traced back to its rightful owner.\n\nHowever, if you find a large sum of money, it would be a good idea to try to locate the owner if possible. You could try to find identification or contact information on the money, or you could turn it over to the local police department. They may be able to help you locate the owner or hold the money until the owner claims it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you find a dollar bill in a public place, such as on the street or in a park, it's generally considered acceptable to keep it. However, if you find a dollar bill in a private place, such as in a store or a restaurant, it would be best to turn it over to the owner or management. This is a matter of courtesy and respect for the property of others.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
