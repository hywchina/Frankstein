{"instruction": "How long does it take our eyes to fully adapt to darkness?", "output": "The time it takes for our eyes to fully adapt to darkness can vary depending on the level of darkness and the individual's sensitivity to light. In a completely dark environment, it can take up to 30 minutes for our eyes to fully adjust. However, in a dimly lit environment, it may only take a few minutes for our eyes to adjust.\n\nThe process of adapting to darkness involves the expansion of the pupil, which allows more light to enter the eye. The rods and cones in the retina also become more sensitive to the available light. This process is called scotopic vision and allows us to see in low light conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that once our eyes have adapted to darkness, they will remain sensitive to light for a period of time after we leave the dark environment. This is known as photostasis and can last for several minutes to an hour. During this time, our eyes will be more sensitive to light than they were before we entered the dark environment.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
