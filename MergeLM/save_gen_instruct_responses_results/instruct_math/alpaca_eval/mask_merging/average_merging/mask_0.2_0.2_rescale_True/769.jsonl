{"instruction": "How many text messages are sent globally in a minute? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "output": "It's difficult to provide an exact number of text messages sent globally in a minute, as there are various factors that can affect the number. However, we can make an estimate based on available data and trends.\n\n1. According to Statista, the number of global text messages sent per minute in 2020 was approximately 23 billion. This number is based on data from mobile network operators and other sources.\n\n2. The number of text messages sent per minute has been increasing over the years due to the growing number of mobile phone users and the increasing use of messaging apps.\n\n3. In 2019, the average number of text messages sent per person per day was 26.3, according to Statista. If we assume that this number is evenly distributed throughout the day, it would mean that approximately 26.3 messages are sent per minute.\n\n4. However, this number doesn't take into account the fact that not all people use their phones at the same time. The number of people using their phones at any given time depends on various factors such as time of day, location, and age group.\n\n5. Additionally, the number of text messages sent per minute can also be affected by the type of messaging app used. Some apps, such as WhatsApp and WeChat, have a higher average number of messages sent per user per day than traditional SMS.\n\n6. Finally, the number of text messages sent per minute can also be affected by network congestion and other technical factors.\n\nIn conclusion, while we can't provide an exact number of text messages sent globally in a minute, we can estimate that it's likely in the tens of billions. The exact number would require more detailed data and analysis, taking into account various factors such as the number of mobile phone users, the average number of messages sent per person per day, the type of messaging app used, and network congestion.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
