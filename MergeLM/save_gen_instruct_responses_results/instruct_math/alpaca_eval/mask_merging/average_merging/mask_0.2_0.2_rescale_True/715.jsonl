{"instruction": "Write the HTML syntax for the required action.\n\nadding an image to the page", "output": "To add an image to a web page using HTML, you can use the <img> tag. Here's the basic syntax:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"image-description\" />\n```\n\nThe `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image file, and the `alt` attribute provides a description of the image for accessibility purposes.\n\nFor example, to add an image of a cat to your page, you could use the following code:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat\" />\n```\n\nThis would display an image of a cat on your page with the description \"A cute cat\" for screen readers and other assistive technologies.\n\nYou can also add additional attributes to the <img> tag to control the size, position, and other aspects of the image. For example, you can use the `width` and `height` attributes to set the dimensions of the image, or the `class` attribute to apply a CSS class to the image.\n\nHere's an example with additional attributes:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute cat\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"center\" />\n```\n\nIn this example, the image will be centered on the page and have dimensions of 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.\n\nRemember to replace \"https://example.com/cat.jpg\" with the actual URL of the image you want to use.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
