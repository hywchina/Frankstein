{"instruction": "Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address.", "output": "To validate an email address using a regular expression in Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_valid_email(email):\n    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None\n```\n\nThis function takes an email address as input and returns `True` if it is valid, and `False` otherwise. The regular expression used in this function is as follows:\n\n```python\nr'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n```\n\nThis regular expression consists of the following components:\n\n1. `^` - Start of the string\n2. `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` - One or more characters from the set of alphanumeric characters, underscore, percent sign, plus sign, and hyphen\n3. `@` - The at symbol\n4. `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` - One or more characters from the set of alphanumeric characters, hyphen, and period\n5. `\\.` - The period character\n6. `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` - Two or more characters from the set of alphanumeric characters\n7. `$` - End of the string\n\nThis regular expression matches an email address that consists of one or more characters from the specified set, followed by the at symbol, followed by one or more characters from the specified set, followed by a period, followed by two or more characters from the specified set.\n\nThe `re.match()` function is used to check if the email address matches the regular expression. If it does, `True` is returned, otherwise `False` is returned.\n\nYou can use this function to validate email addresses in your Python code:\n\n```python\nemail = \"example@example.com\"\nif is_valid_email(email):\n    print(\"The email address is valid.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The email address is not valid.\")\n```\n\nThis code will print \"The email address is valid.\" if the email address is valid, and \"The email address is not valid.\" if it is not.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "vicuna"}
