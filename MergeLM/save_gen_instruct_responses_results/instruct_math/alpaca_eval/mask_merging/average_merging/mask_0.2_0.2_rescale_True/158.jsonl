{"instruction": "Can a boy and girl be just be best friends only ever\n", "output": "Yes, a boy and a girl can be just best friends without any romantic or sexual involvement. It is possible for two people of any gender to have a deep and meaningful friendship based on mutual respect, trust, and shared interests.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there may be some challenges in maintaining a purely platonic relationship, especially in a society where romantic and sexual relationships are often the norm. Some people may not understand or accept the idea of a close friendship between a boy and a girl, and may try to impose their own expectations or assumptions onto the relationship.\n\nIt's important for both the boy and the girl to be clear about their intentions and boundaries, and to communicate openly and honestly with each other about their feelings and expectations. If both parties are committed to maintaining a purely platonic relationship, it can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both of them.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
