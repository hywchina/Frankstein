{"instruction": "Is a thumb war violent?", "output": "A thumb war is a playful activity that involves two people gently pressing their thumbs against each other, trying to force the other person's thumb down. It is typically played between children or as a lighthearted competition between adults. While it can involve some physical contact and may cause temporary discomfort, it is generally not considered violent. Violence typically involves intentional harm or aggression, which is not the case in a thumb war.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
