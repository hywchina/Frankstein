{"instruction": "Identify all words that match the pattern given.\n\nH_AR_", "output": "The pattern you provided is \"H_AR_\". To identify all words that match this pattern, we can break it down into three parts: \"H\", \"AR\", and \"_\".\n\n1. \"H\": This is a single letter, so it can be any word that starts with \"H\". Some examples include \"house\", \"happy\", \"horse\", \"hero\", etc.\n\n2. \"AR\": This is a two-letter combination, so it can be any word that starts with \"AR\". Some examples include \"army\", \"arrive\", \"arctic\", \"aroma\", etc.\n\n3. \"_\": This is a single underscore, which represents any single letter or a combination of letters. It can be any word that has a single letter or a combination of letters in that position.\n\nNow, let's put these three parts together to form words that match the pattern \"H_AR_\".\n\n1. House_: This is a word that starts with \"H\", has \"AR\" in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n2. Happy_: This is a word that starts with \"H\", has \"AR\" in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n3. Horse_: This is a word that starts with \"H\", has \"AR\" in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n4. Hero_: This is a word that starts with \"H\", has \"AR\" in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n5. Army_: This is a word that starts with \"AR\", has a single letter in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n6. Arrive_: This is a word that starts with \"AR\", has a single letter in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n7. Arctic_: This is a word that starts with \"AR\", has a single letter in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\n8. Aroma_: This is a word that starts with \"AR\", has a single letter in the middle, and ends with a single letter.\n\nThese are all the words that match the pattern \"H_AR_\".", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
