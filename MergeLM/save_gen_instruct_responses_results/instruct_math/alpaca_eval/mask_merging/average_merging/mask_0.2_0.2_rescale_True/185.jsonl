{"instruction": "cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey", "output": "To calculate the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, we first need to determine how much fuel the car will consume for this journey.\n\nWe can do this by using the formula:\n\nFuel consumption = Distance / Miles per gallon\n\nIn this case, the distance is 14 miles and the miles per gallon is 48. So, the fuel consumption for the journey is:\n\nFuel consumption = 14 miles / 48 mpg = 0.29 gallons\n\nNow that we know the car will consume 0.29 gallons of fuel for the journey, we can calculate the cost of this fuel. We are given that the cost of fuel is 625 pence per gallon. So, the cost of the fuel for the journey is:\n\nCost of fuel = Fuel consumption * Cost per gallon\nCost of fuel = 0.29 gallons * 625 pence/gallon = 187.5 pence\n\nHowever, the question states that there is heavy traffic for half of the journey. This means that the time spent in traffic will affect the car's fuel consumption. We can calculate the fuel consumption for the time spent in traffic using the same formula as before:\n\nFuel consumption = Distance / Miles per gallon\n\nFor the time spent in traffic, the distance is half of the total distance, which is 14 miles / 2 = 7 miles. The miles per gallon remains the same, which is 48 mpg. So, the fuel consumption for the time spent in traffic is:\n\nFuel consumption = 7 miles / 48 mpg = 0.146 gallons\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of the fuel for the time spent in traffic:\n\nCost of fuel for traffic = Fuel consumption * Cost per gallon\nCost of fuel for traffic = 0.146 gallons * 625 pence/gallon = 91.875 pence\n\nFinally, we can add the cost of fuel for the time spent in traffic to the cost of fuel for the rest of the journey to get the total cost of fuel for the 14-mile journey:\n\nTotal cost of fuel = Cost of fuel for traffic + Cost of fuel for non-traffic\nTotal cost of fuel = 91.875 pence + 187.5 pence = 279.375 pence\n\nSo, the total cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48 mpg, with heavy traffic for half the journey, is 279.375 pence.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
