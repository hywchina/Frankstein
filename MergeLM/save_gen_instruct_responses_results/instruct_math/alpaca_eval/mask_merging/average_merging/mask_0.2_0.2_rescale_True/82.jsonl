{"instruction": "Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?", "output": "Hi! Congratulations on deciding to keep a rat as a pet. Rats are intelligent, social, and loving animals that make great companions. Here's a guide to help you house, feed, and care for your new pet rat:\n\n1. Housing: Rats need a spacious cage to move around and exercise. The minimum size for a rat cage is 24 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches high. You can buy a cage or build one yourself using wire mesh or plastic. Line the bottom of the cage with bedding material like paper towels, shredded paper, or aspen shavings. Avoid using cedar or pine shavings as they can be harmful to rats. Provide hiding places like cardboard boxes or tubes for your rat to sleep and play in.\n\n2. Feeding: Rats are omnivores and need a balanced diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, and protein. A good quality rat food pellet should be the main part of their diet. You can supplement this with fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, broccoli, and spinach. Avoid feeding them foods high in fat and sugar like chocolate, candy, and junk food. Provide fresh water in a bottle or a bowl daily.\n\n3. Exercise: Rats need to exercise daily to stay healthy and happy. Provide toys and accessories like exercise wheels, tunnels, and chew toys to keep them entertained. You can also let them out of their cage for supervised playtime.\n\n4. Grooming: Rats need regular grooming to keep their fur clean and healthy. Brush their fur with a soft brush once a week to remove loose hair and prevent mats. Trim their nails every few weeks to prevent overgrowth. Check their ears and teeth regularly for signs of infection or problems.\n\n5. Health: Rats are prone to certain health problems like respiratory infections, tumors, and dental problems. Regular vet check-ups and a healthy diet can help prevent these issues.\n\n6. Socialization: Rats are social animals and need to be kept in pairs or groups. They can become stressed and depressed if kept alone.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can provide your rat with a happy and healthy life. Good luck with your new pet!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
