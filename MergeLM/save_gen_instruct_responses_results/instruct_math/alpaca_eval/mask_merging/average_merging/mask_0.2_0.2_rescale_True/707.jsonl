{"instruction": "Predict how many stars the author will give to the restaurant from a Yelp review.\n\nThe reviews were great, but honestly i felt it was just ok. Seemed like a typical tourist spot were the food was mediocre. The service was ok, not great, but not the worst.\nThe bread was very good. I ordered the muscle fries. They had a sweet Vidalia onion flavor. No need for fries bc they were soggy wo much flavor. My boyfriend ordered a pesto chicken pasta and it was again mediocre.", "output": "Based on the Yelp review, the author seems to have mixed feelings about the restaurant. They mention that the reviews were great, but they felt it was just okay. The food was mediocre, and the service was not great but not the worst. The bread was good, but the fries were soggy and lacked flavor. The pesto chicken pasta was also mediocre.\n\nConsidering the mixed feelings and the mediocre food and service, I would predict that the author will give the restaurant 2 out of 5 stars.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
