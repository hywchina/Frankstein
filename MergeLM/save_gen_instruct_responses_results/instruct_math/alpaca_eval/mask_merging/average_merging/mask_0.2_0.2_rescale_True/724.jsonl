{"instruction": "Explain the meaning of the given phrase in simple terms. Use an example if possible. It would be helpful if you could give an example.\n\n\"With a little give in them\"", "output": "The phrase \"with a little give in them\" refers to a situation where there is some flexibility or room for negotiation. It suggests that there is a certain amount of wiggle room or leeway in a particular situation or agreement.\n\nFor example, if you're negotiating a deal with someone, they might say \"I'm willing to compromise on the price, but there has to be a little give in it.\" This means that they are willing to lower the price, but they still want to get a good deal. They are not willing to sell at a loss, but they are willing to be flexible and find a middle ground.\n\nAnother example could be in a relationship. If one person says \"I need a little give in you,\" it means they want their partner to be understanding and willing to compromise. They want their partner to be flexible and willing to work through problems together.\n\nIn both examples, the phrase \"with a little give in them\" suggests that there is some room for negotiation or flexibility, but it doesn't mean that one side will get everything they want. It's about finding a balance and working together to reach a mutually beneficial solution.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
