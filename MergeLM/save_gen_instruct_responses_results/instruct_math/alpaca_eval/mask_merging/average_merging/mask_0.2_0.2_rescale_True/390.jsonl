They help to create more complex and interesting sentences by combining different elements. The FANBOYS are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. Each of these conjunctions has a specific function and can be used in different situations. For example, \"for\" is used to introduce a cause or reason, \"and\" is used to connect two ideas, \"nor\" is used to negate two ideas, \"but\" is used to contrast two ideas, \"or\" is used to offer a choice, \"yet\" is used to show a contrast between two ideas, and \"so\" is used to introduce a conclusion. By understanding the function of each FANBOY, you can use them effectively in your writing to create more sophisticated and nuanced sentences.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
