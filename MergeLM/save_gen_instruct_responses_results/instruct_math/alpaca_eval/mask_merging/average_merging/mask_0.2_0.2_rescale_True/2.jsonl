{"instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the rules of kickball!\n\nKickball is a team sport that is similar to baseball, but instead of using a bat, players kick a large ball to hit it. Here's a breakdown of how the game is played:\n\n1. The game is played between two teams, with each team having 10 players on the field at a time.\n2. The field is divided into two parts: the infield and the outfield. The infield consists of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. The outfield is the area beyond the bases.\n3. Each team takes turns playing offense (kicking the ball) and defense (fielding the ball).\n4. The game starts with the team on defense throwing the ball to the team on offense. The player who kicks the ball must kick it into the infield.\n5. If the ball is kicked into the infield, the player who kicked it must run to first base. The fielders then try to catch the ball and throw it to the appropriate base to get the runner out.\n6. If the ball is kicked into the outfield, the player who kicked it can run to any base they want. The fielders must run to the spot where the ball was kicked and try to throw it to the appropriate base to get the runner out.\n7. If a player is running to a base and is tagged with the ball before they reach the base, they are out.\n8. If a player kicks the ball over the fence in the outfield, it is a home run, and the player is awarded 3 points.\n9. If a player is walked (four balls are thrown outside the strike zone), they are awarded 1 point.\n10. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nThat's the basic rules of kickball! It's a fun and easy game to play, and I'm sure you'll have a great time with your sister and her friends. Just remember to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to run!", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
