{"instruction": "Whats the largest star in our galaxy?", "output": "The largest star in our galaxy is VY Canis Majoris, a red hypergiant located in the constellation Canis Major. It is approximately 2,100 times larger than our sun and has a radius of about 1,420 solar radii. This means that if VY Canis Majoris were placed at the center of our solar system, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Saturn. Despite its immense size, VY Canis Majoris is also extremely luminous, emitting up to 100,000 times more light than our sun. However, due to its distance from Earth (approximately 5,000 light-years), it is not visible to the naked eye.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
