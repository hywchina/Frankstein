The song is about a relationship where the narrator is in love with someone who is unconventional and doesn't follow the norms of society.\n\nThe first line, \"My lover's got humor,\" suggests that the person the narrator is in love with is someone who can find humor in any situation, even in the face of adversity. This is an important characteristic for the narrator, as it helps them deal with the challenges that come with being in a relationship with someone who doesn't conform to societal expectations.\n\nThe second line, \"She's the giggle at a funeral,\" is a metaphor that further emphasizes this point. The image of a giggle at a funeral is unexpected and incongruous, just like the relationship the narrator is in. It suggests that the narrator's lover is someone who can find joy and laughter in the most unlikely of places, which is a quality that the narrator finds endearing.\n\nThe third line, \"Knows everybody's disapproval,\" suggests that the narrator's lover is aware of the disapproval and criticism they receive from others for their unconventional behavior. However, the narrator implies that they don't care about what others think, as they are in love with their lover's unique qualities.\n\nThe final line, \"I should've worshipped her sooner,\" is a reflection on the narrator's realization that they should have appreciated their lover's qualities earlier. It suggests that the narrator has come to realize the true value of their lover and is now grateful for their presence in their life.\n\nOverall, the lyrics describe a relationship where the narrator is in love with someone who is unconventional and doesn't follow the norms of society. The narrator finds these qualities endearing and is grateful for their presence in their life. The metaphors used in the lyrics, such as the giggle at a funeral, help to emphasize the unique and unexpected nature of the relationship.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}
