{"instruction": "Has there been any news regarding a potential release date for Starcraft 3?", "output": "As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there has been no official announcement or news regarding a potential release date for Starcraft 3. The last game in the series, Starcraft 2, was released in 2010, and since then, there have been no updates or indications from Blizzard Entertainment, the developer of the Starcraft series, about a possible sequel.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Starcraft franchise is still active, with Blizzard releasing new content for Starcraft 2, such as expansions and updates, and also hosting competitive tournaments for the game. So, while there may not be any news about Starcraft 3 at the moment, the franchise is still alive and well.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Blizzard has been focusing on other projects recently, such as Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, so it's possible that Starcraft 3 is not a priority for them at the moment. But who knows, maybe we'll hear some news about it in the future.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
