{"instruction": "What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame? Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?", "output": "To stream at 720p 30fps to Twitch while playing an online videogame, you will need a minimum upload speed of 3000 kbps. However, it's always better to have some extra headroom to ensure that both the Twitch stream and online gameplay are smooth.\n\nTo calculate the extra headroom you need, you should consider the bitrate of your gameplay and add it to the recommended bitrate for streaming. The bitrate of your gameplay will depend on the specific game and its settings. You can use a tool like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to measure the bitrate of your gameplay.\n\nOnce you have the bitrate of your gameplay, add it to the recommended bitrate for streaming, which is 3000 kbps. For example, if your gameplay bitrate is 5000 kbps, you would need a total upload speed of 8000 kbps (3000 kbps + 5000 kbps).\n\nKeep in mind that these are minimum requirements, and you may need more upload speed depending on the specific game and its settings, as well as the quality of your stream. It's always better to have more upload speed than less, as it will ensure a smoother and more reliable stream.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "oasst"}
