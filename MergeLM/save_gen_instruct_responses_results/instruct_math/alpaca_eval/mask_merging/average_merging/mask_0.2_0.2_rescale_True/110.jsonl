{"instruction": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.  Go ahead and start a draft!", "output": "Once upon a time, in a New York high-rise co-op, there lived a group of immortal cats. These cats were not like any other cats you've ever known. They were not mortal, and they were not ordinary. They were immortal, and they had lived for centuries, watching the world change around them.\n\nTheir home was a luxurious apartment on the 20th floor, with a view of the city that never slept. They had everything they could ever want: food, water, toys, and each other. They were a close-knit group, and they spent their days lounging in the sun, chasing each other around the apartment, and watching the world go by through the large windows.\n\nTheir leader was a wise and ancient cat named Cleopatra. She had lived for thousands of years, and she had seen it all. She was the one who had brought the other cats together, and she was the one who kept them safe and happy.\n\nOne day, a new cat arrived at the apartment. Her name was Luna, and she was a young and curious cat. She had been wandering the streets of New York, looking for a place to call home, when she stumbled upon the high-rise co-op. She was drawn to the cats inside, and she decided to join them.\n\nAt first, the other cats were wary of Luna. They had never seen a cat like her before, and they didn't know if they could trust her. But Cleopatra, with her wisdom and kindness, welcomed Luna into their home.\n\nOver time, Luna became an integral part of the group. She learned the ways of the immortal cats, and she grew to love them as her own family. She spent her days lounging in the sun with the others, chasing them around the apartment, and watching the world go by.\n\nBut as the years passed, Luna began to notice changes in the world outside the apartment. The city was changing, and it was changing fast. The buildings were getting taller, the streets were getting busier, and the people were getting stranger.\n\nLuna was worried about the future, and she confided in Cleopatra. Cleopatra listened to her concerns and offered her wisdom. She told Luna that the world would always change, and that the only thing that remained constant was the love and friendship of those around her.\n\nAnd so, Luna learned to embrace the changes in the world, and she continued to live her life with the immortal cats in the high-rise co-op. She knew that no matter what the future held, she would always have a home with her family, and that was all that mattered.\n\nThe end.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
