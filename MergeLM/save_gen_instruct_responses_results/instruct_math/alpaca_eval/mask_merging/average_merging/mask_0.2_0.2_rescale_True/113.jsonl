{"instruction": "What color is the sky", "output": "The color of the sky is blue. This is because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is when sunlight hits the Earth's atmosphere and the shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer, red wavelengths. This makes the sky appear blue to our eyes. However, the color of the sky can also change depending on the time of day, weather conditions, and location. For example, at sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink due to the way the sun's light interacts with the atmosphere.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "helpful_base"}
