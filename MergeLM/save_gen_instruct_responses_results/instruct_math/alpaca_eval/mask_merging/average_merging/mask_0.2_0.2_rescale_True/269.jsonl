{"instruction": "A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. <br>He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over?", "output": "First, we need to determine the rate at which the value of the old car and the new car decrease each month. The old car decreases in value by 1.5% per month, and the new car decreases in value by 1.5% + 0.5% = 2% per month.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much money the man saves each month. He saves $1000 per month.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much the old car will be worth after a certain number of months. We can use the formula:\n\nValue of old car after n months = Value of old car initially * (1 - (1.5/100) * n)\n\nAnd the value of the new car after n months:\n\nValue of new car after n months = Value of new car initially * (1 - (2/100) * n)\n\nThe man wants to buy the new car when the value of his old car is equal to the value of the new car. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nValue of old car after n months = Value of new car after n months\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for n:\n\n2000 * (1 - (1.5/100) * n) = 8000 * (1 - (2/100) * n)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2000 * (1 - 0.015n) = 8000 * (1 - 0.02n)\n\n2000 - 300n = 8000 - 160n\n\n1400n = 6000\n\nn = 6000 / 1400\n\nn = 4.2857\n\nSince the man can't buy the car after a fraction of a month, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take him approximately 4 months to save up enough money to buy the new car.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money he will have left over after buying the new car. We can use the following formula:\n\nMoney left over = Value of old car initially - Value of new car initially\n\nMoney left over = 2000 - 8000\n\nMoney left over = -6000\n\nSo, the man will have -$6000 left over after buying the new car. This means he will be in debt by $6000.\n\nThe answer is: it will take him approximately 4 months to save up enough money to buy the new car, and he will have -$6000 left over.", "generator": "./save_merge_models/instruct_math/instruct/mask_merging/average_merging/mask_0.2_0.2_rescale_True", "dataset": "koala"}
